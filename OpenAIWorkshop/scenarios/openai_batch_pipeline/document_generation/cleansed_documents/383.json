    "summary": "\n\nThe customer contacted the agent about not being able to access the channels they wanted after downgrading their Contoso Wireless service. The agent looked up the customer's account and explained that certain features are removed when services are downgraded and cannot be added back without upgrading again. The agent then offered other packages available which included access to over 100 HD channels, on-demand library, and advanced DVR capabilities. The customer chose the premium package which costs $79.99 per month plus applicable taxes and fees, and the customer agreed to sign up for it.",
