They also discussed the type of phone needed for the downgrade service and offered to direct the customer to their website for more information. Finally, they reminded the customer that there may be additional fees associated with future upgrades or switches, and that any discounts associated with their current plan may no longer apply. The customer service agent then asked for the customer's full name and address in order to verify their account information and begin processing the request.",
