    "summary": "\n\nThe customer was having trouble with their Contoso Wireless TV, which was not turning on. The agent helped the customer troubleshoot the issue by asking if any lights were illuminated and suggesting they unplug the power cord from the back of the TV and press and hold down the power button for 10 seconds. When this did not work, they suggested resetting the satellite receiver by unplugging it for 10 seconds and then plugging it back in. This resolved the issue and the customer thanked the agent for their help.",
