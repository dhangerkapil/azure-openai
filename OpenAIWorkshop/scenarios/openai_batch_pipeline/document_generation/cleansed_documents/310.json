    "summary": "\n\nThe customer purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless on a two-year contract and was surprised to receive a bill that was twice what they expected. The agent explained that the $600 cost of the phone was just the down payment, and the rest of the cost was spread out over the two-year contract. The agent apologized for any confusion and offered to work with the customer to find a payment plan that works best for their budget.",
