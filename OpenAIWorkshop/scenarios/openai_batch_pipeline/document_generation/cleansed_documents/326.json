    "summary": "\n\nThe customer was inquiring about Contoso Wireless' downgrade services. The agent explained that when purchasing a TV with Contoso Wireless, customers receive a free month of service. After that, they can choose to downgrade their service to a lower tier package at any time and save money, although some features may not be available. The agent also clarified that if the customer stays with the same tier package, they will still have access to all their current channels and data speeds. Additionally, when downgrading the service the monthly bill will be reduced and if the customer wants to upgrade back to the original package in the future, they can do so without any additional fees or charges.",
