    "summary": "\n\nIn this customer service exchange, the customer was frustrated with a product they purchased from Contoso Wireless. The customer service representative apologized for the inconvenience and asked for more details about the issue. After learning that the product was a phone and that it wouldn't turn on, the representative suggested running a diagnostic test on the device to determine what might be causing the issue. The customer confirmed they had access to a computer, so the representative instructed them to open up their web browser and type in www.contosowireless.com/diagnostics into the search bar to begin running tests.",
