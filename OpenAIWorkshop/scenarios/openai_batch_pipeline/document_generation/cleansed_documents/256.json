    "summary": " \n\nIn this customer service call, the customer contacted Contoso Wireless because they were not receiving the internet speeds that were promised to them. The agent offered to take a look at their account and investigate any potential issues with their router or modem that might be causing the slow speeds. The agent also suggested that the customer restart all of their devices connected to the network in order to see if that helps. The agent concluded the call by asking the customer to call back once they have restarted all of their devices so they can discuss further steps to get the customer's speeds up to where they should be.",
