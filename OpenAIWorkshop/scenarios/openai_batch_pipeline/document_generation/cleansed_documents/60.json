The agent provided information on additional packages and add-ons that could be beneficial for the customer. After discussing the options, the customer decided to sign up for the Contoso Platinum package which included access to all channels from both packages plus additional premium channels, 10GB of extra data per month, unlimited local and long-distance calling within the US, and free international calls to over 50 countries. The agent then assisted the customer with setting up their new package.",
