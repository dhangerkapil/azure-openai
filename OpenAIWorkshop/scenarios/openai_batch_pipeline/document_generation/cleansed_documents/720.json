    "summary": "\n\nThe customer was having issues with Contoso Wireless' internet service, including slow speeds and unreliable connections. The customer service agent checked the system and found that the issue was being caused by external factors beyond their control. The agent suggested resetting the router or modem to improve the connection speed and reliability while they worked on resolving the underlying issue. If resetting the router or modem doesn't work, then other troubleshooting methods such as updating device drivers or uninstalling software can be tried. If none of these methods work, then the customer should contact Contoso Wireless again for further investigation.",
