The agent investigated the issue and found that there was an issue with one of the towers in the customer's area which was causing a decrease in signal strength and slower speeds than usual. The agent apologized for the inconvenience and assured the customer that their speeds should return back to normal shortly. The customer thanked the agent for their help and was informed that they do not need to do anything else - just wait for the speeds to return back to normal as the issue is being resolved from their end.",
