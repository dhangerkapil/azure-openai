    "summary": "\nThe customer asked about a one-time fee of $50 that was added to their bill. The customer service agent explained that this fee was for the activation of the TV and offered the customer the Contoso Wireless subscription plan as an alternative to avoid this fee in the future. The subscription plan includes unlimited access to products and services, discounts, priority customer service, and exclusive offers and promotions. The customer was also informed that if they cancel their subscription at any time, they will be charged a cancellation fee, but if they stay with the company for at least 6 months, they will waive the cancellation fee.",
