Agent: Okay, have you tried resetting the device? 

Customer: Yes, I have tried resetting it multiple times but nothing seems to be working. 

Agent: Alright, let me look into this further for you. Can you please provide me with a few more details about the issue that you are having? 

Customer: Sure, when I try to power on the device, nothing happens. The screen remains blank and no lights appear to be lit up on the device. 

Agent: Alright, it looks like there may be an issue with the power supply of the device. We will need to send you a new power supply unit so that you can get your device up and running again. Can I please get your address so that we can send out a new power supply unit?
