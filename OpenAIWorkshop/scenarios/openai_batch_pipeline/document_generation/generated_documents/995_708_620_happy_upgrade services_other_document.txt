Customer: Hi there, I am interested in upgrading my phone with Contoso Wireless. What options do I have? 

Agent: Hi there! We have a variety of options available for customers looking to upgrade their phones. What type of phone are you currently using?

Customer: I have an iPhone 8. 

Agent: Great! We can offer you the newest model, the iPhone 11. It comes with a variety of features, such as a longer battery life, improved cameras, and more. Would you like to hear more about it? 

Customer: Absolutely! I'm very interested in hearing more about it. 

Agent: The iPhone 11 has a beautiful 6.1-inch Liquid Retina HD display, making it perfect for watching movies and playing games. It also has an A13 Bionic chip, which is the fastest chip ever in a smartphone. The battery life is up to 17 hours, which means you can use your phone all day without worrying about running out of power. The camera system has two 12MP cameras for ultra wide and wide shots, as well as Night Mode for amazing low-light photos. Plus, you get a free pair of AirPods with your purchase. 

Customer: That sounds great! I'm sold on the iPhone 11. What else do I need to know before I upgrade? 

Agent: Well, you'll need to pick out a data plan that works best for you. We offer different plans with different data limits and prices, so you can choose one that fits your needs and budget. Additionally, if you'd like to add any accessories or services such as insurance or cloud storage, we can help you with that as well. 

Customer: That sounds great! What is the process for upgrading my phone? 

Agent: The process is very simple and straightforward. First, you'll need to select the plan and any additional services or accessories that you'd like to add to your purchase. Once that's done, we'll send you an email with instructions on how to complete the upgrade process online or over the phone. You'll also receive a tracking number so that you can follow the progress of your order until it arrives at your doorstep. 

Customer: Perfect! That sounds very easy and convenient. Is there anything else I should know before I upgrade? 

Agent: Yes! Make sure to back up all of your data before completing the upgrade process - this will ensure that none of your information is lost during the transition from one phone to another. Additionally, if you have any questions or concerns during the process, please don't hesitate to reach out to us - our customer service team is always here to help!
