Customer: Hi, I'm having some trouble with my bill.

Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that. How can I help?

Customer: I'm not sure what's going on. My bill is much higher than it normally is and I don't understand why.

Agent: Okay, let me take a look at your account. Could you please provide me with your account number? 

Customer: Sure, it's 123456789. 

Agent: Thank you. I have pulled up your account and it looks like you have been charged for a new product that you recently purchased. Is that correct? 

Customer: Yes, that's right. I just bought a new Contoso Wireless phone. 

Agent: Okay, great! It looks like the charges for the phone are reflected in your bill. Is there anything else that I can help you with? 

Customer: Well, I'm still not sure why my bill is so much higher than usual. Could you explain why that might be? 

Agent: Sure, of course! It looks like you are also being charged for the data plan associated with your new phone. This is an additional charge that will be reflected on your bill each month until you cancel the data plan. Does that make sense? 

Customer: Oh, okay. So I'm paying for both the phone and the data plan then? 

Agent: That's correct. The data plan will give you access to the internet and other services on your phone, so it's an important part of owning a Contoso Wireless device. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that makes sense now. Thank you for explaining it to me!
