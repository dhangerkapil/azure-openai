"I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless phone and I'm having trouble getting it to work properly. I've tried the online support, but it didn't help me. Can someone please help me with this?"

Agent: 
"Hello there! I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your Contoso Wireless phone. It sounds like you need some help troubleshooting the issue. Is there anything specific that you need help with?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I can't seem to get my Contoso phone to connect to the network. I've tried resetting it multiple times but nothing seems to work."

Agent: 
"Alright, let's try and get your Contoso phone connected. What kind of network are you trying to connect to? Is it a Wi-Fi network or a cellular network?"

Customer: 
"I'm trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network. I've entered the password correctly, but it still won't connect."

Agent: 
"Ok, have you tried rebooting the router? Sometimes that can help when trying to connect a device to a Wi-Fi network."

Customer: 
"Yes, I've rebooted the router multiple times and still nothing is working."

Agent: 
"Hmmm, that's strange. Have you tried resetting the phone back to its factory settings? That should help in getting it connected to the Wi-Fi network."

Customer: 
"I've done that as well and still nothing is working. This is really frustrating." 

Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Let me look into this further and see if there's anything else we can try. In the meantime, why don't you try connecting your Contoso phone to another Wi-Fi network and see if that works? That might give us some insight into what the issue could be."
