Hi, I'm having a problem with my Contoso Wireless account. I was charged for a streaming product that I never purchased and I want to know why. 

Contoso Wireless Agent:

Hello, and thank you for reaching out to Contoso Wireless. I'm sorry to hear that you were charged for a streaming product that you didn't purchase. Can you please provide me with your account information so I can look into this further? 

Customer: 

My account information is [account information] and my name is [name]. 

Contoso Wireless Agent:

Thank you for providing your account information. Let me take a look and see what's going on. Please give me one moment while I investigate this issue. 

Customer: 

Ok, thank you. 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 
Alright, I have looked into the matter and it appears that the charge was made for a subscription to our streaming service. Did you sign up for this service at any point? 

Customer: 
No, I did not sign up for any streaming services. How did this charge end up on my account? 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 
I understand your confusion. It appears that the charge was made from an email that was sent out to our customers offering a free trial of the streaming service. Did you receive such an email from us? 

Customer: 
Yes, I did receive an email offering the free trial but I didn't sign up for it. How did this charge end up on my account? 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 
It appears that when you received the email, there was a link included that allowed you to sign up for the free trial of our streaming service. It appears that when you clicked on the link, it automatically added the charge to your account even though you didn't complete the signup process. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and we are happy to refund the charge to your account. Is there anything else we can help you with today?
