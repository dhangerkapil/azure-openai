Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your phone. We'd be happy to help you downgrade your service. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue you're having?

Customer: Well, it's just not working properly. It's been randomly shutting down and won't let me make calls or access the internet.

Agent: I see. That sounds like a frustrating issue. We'll definitely look into it and see if there's anything we can do to help. In the meantime, would you like to downgrade your service plan while we investigate the issue?

Customer: Yes, I'd like to downgrade my service plan. What options do I have?

Agent: We offer three different plans for Contoso Wireless customers: Basic, Plus and Premium. The Basic plan is our most affordable option and includes up to 2GB of data per month with no additional fees or taxes. The Plus plan includes 5GB of data and additional discounts on certain services, and the Premium plan offers unlimited data and even more discounts on certain services. 

Customer: That's great, thank you for explaining the different plans to me. But what about my current phone? Can I still use it if I downgrade my service?

Agent: Yes, you can still use your current phone if you decide to downgrade your service plan. However, depending on which plan you choose, there may be some features or services that are no longer available on your device. 

Customer: Alright, that makes sense. So if I decide to go with the Basic plan, what kind of features would be unavailable?

Agent: If you choose the Basic plan, certain advanced features such as streaming video or music may not be available on your device. Additionally, if you're using an older device, some of the newer features such as Wi-Fi calling may not be available either. 

Customer: Got it. Is there any way I can get these features back if I decide to upgrade my plan in the future? 

Agent: Absolutely! If you decide to upgrade your plan in the future, all of the features and services available on our higher-tier plans will become available again on your device. 

Customer: Great! That's really helpful. So how do I go about downgrading my service? 

Agent: You can easily downgrade your service by visiting our website or by calling our customer service line at 1-800-CONTOSO (1-800-266-8676). Our customer service team will be able to walk you through the process step by step and answer any questions that you may have along the way.
