Customer: 
Hello, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm having a problem with my account. I recently purchased one of your phones and I can't seem to activate it. Can you help me?

Agent: 
Hello, my name is [Agent Name] and I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your account. Could you please tell me a bit more about the issue you're having?

Customer: 
Yes, I purchased a Contoso Wireless phone a few days ago and I've been trying to activate it but it just won't work. I've tried everything but nothing seems to be working.

Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this must be. Let's see what we can do to help you out. Are you able to provide me with the serial number of the phone?

Customer: 
Yes, the serial number is [Insert Serial Number Here].

Agent: 
Great, thank you for providing me with that information. Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on here. Please bear with me for a few minutes while I investigate this further. 

Customer: 
Okay, thank you. 

Agent: 
I have taken a look at your account and it appears that there is an issue with the activation process. It looks like there is an issue with the SIM card in your phone, which is preventing it from being activated. We can resolve this by sending you a new SIM card or by having you come into one of our stores so we can replace it for you. Which option would you prefer? 

Customer: 
I'd rather not have to go into the store if possible. Can you just send me a new SIM card? 

Agent: 
Certainly, we can do that for you. I will need to place an order for a new SIM card and have it shipped to your address on file. Is that alright? 

Customer: 
Yes, that's fine. How long will it take for the SIM card to arrive? 

Agent: 
It should arrive within 3-5 business days depending on where you live. Once you receive the SIM card, all you need to do is insert it into your phone and then follow the instructions for activating it on our website. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

 Customer: No, that should be all for now. Thank you for your help!
