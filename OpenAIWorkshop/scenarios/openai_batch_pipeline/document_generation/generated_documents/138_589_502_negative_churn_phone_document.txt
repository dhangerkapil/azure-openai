Hello, I'm looking for some help. I recently purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and it has been nothing but problems. The phone is always freezing up and I can't seem to get any service at all. I am very frustrated and I'm considering canceling my contract with you guys. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent:

Hello, I apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with your phone. We take customer satisfaction very seriously here at Contoso Wireless, so I would like to try to resolve this issue for you. Could you please tell me more about the issues you are having with your phone? 

Customer:

Sure, when I turn on the phone it takes forever to start up and then it freezes up when I try to use it. The phone also keeps losing service even in areas where it should have good coverage. It's been a huge headache and I'm not sure how much longer I can deal with it. 

Customer Service Agent:

I understand how frustrating this must be for you and we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. We want to do everything we can to help resolve this issue as quickly as possible. Can you tell me if the phone is still under warranty? 

Customer:
Yes, the phone is still under warranty so that shouldn't be a problem. 

Customer Service Agent:
Great! In that case, we can start by troubleshooting the issue over the phone with you or we can arrange for a technician to come out and take a look at your device in person. Which would you prefer? 

Customer: 
I think having a technician come out would be best since the problem seems to be quite severe. 

Customer Service Agent: 
No problem! We can arrange for a technician to come out as soon as possible and take a look at your device. Is there anything else we can do for you in the meantime? 

 Customer: 
Well, I'm really not happy with my current plan and was wondering if there was anything else that could be done about that? 

 Customer Service Agent: 
Of course! We would be more than happy to review your current plan and see if there is anything else we can offer that would better suit your needs. Would you like us to do that now or would you prefer us to wait until after the technician has looked at your device?
