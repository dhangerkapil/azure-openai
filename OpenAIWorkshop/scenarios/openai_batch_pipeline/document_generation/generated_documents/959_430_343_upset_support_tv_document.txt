"I'm so frustrated! I just purchased a new Contoso Wireless TV and it's not working. I've been trying to get it to turn on for the past hour but nothing is happening. I'm really upset and I want to get this resolved as soon as possible."

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please tell me what model of Contoso Wireless TV you purchased?"

Customer: 
"It's the CTV-5545-B."

Agent: 
"Ok, thank you. Can you please describe the issue in more detail? Is the TV not powering on, or are you experiencing another issue?"

Customer: 
"It won't power on at all. When I press the power button, nothing happens. No lights come on or anything."

Agent: 
"I understand your frustration. Have you tried checking the power cord connection to ensure it is securely plugged in?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, I've checked that already and it seems to be connected properly."

Agent: 
"Alright, have you tried resetting the TV by unplugging it from the wall for a few minutes then plugging it back in?" 

Customer: 
"No, I haven't tried that yet. Do you think that would help?" 

Agent: 
"It's worth a shot. If resetting the TV doesn't work, please contact our support line so we can assist you further." 

 Customer: 
"Okay, I'll give it a try. Thank you for your help."
