Hello, I'm having some trouble with my Contoso Wireless TV. I'm not able to get it to turn on. Is there any way you can help me?

Agent:

Hi there! I'm sorry to hear you're having issues with your TV. We'd be more than happy to help you out. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue you're having?

Customer: 
Yes, I've been trying to turn on my Contoso Wireless TV for the past hour, but it won't power up no matter what I do. It's really frustrating.

Agent: 
I completely understand your frustration. We'll do our best to get this issue sorted out for you. Could you please tell me what kind of TV it is and what model number? 

Customer: 
It's a Contoso Wireless 42-inch flat-screen 4K Ultra HD TV with model number CTV42H2D3. 

Agent: 
Thanks for that information. Let me check into this issue for you. Could you please confirm the serial number of the TV as well? 

Customer: 
Yes, sure, the serial number is 0Z4CTTV122149937X9. 

Agent: 
Thanks for that information. I'll just take a few minutes to look into this for you and see if we can figure out what's going on with your TV. In the meantime, could you please tell me if any lights are coming on when you try to power up the TV? 

Customer: 
No, nothing at all is happening when I press the power button - no lights, no sound, nothing. It's just completely dead. 

Agent: 
I see. Well, it looks like your TV may have an issue with its power supply or possibly a loose connection somewhere in its circuitry. We recommend that you take it into an authorized Contoso Wireless service center so they can take a look at it and diagnose the problem properly. Once we have an assessment of the issue, we'll be able to advise you further on how to proceed from there. Does that sound okay? 

Customer: 
Yes, that sounds great. Where is the nearest service center located?
