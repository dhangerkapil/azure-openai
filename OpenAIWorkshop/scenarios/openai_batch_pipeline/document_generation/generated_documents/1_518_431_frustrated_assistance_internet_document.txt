"I'm so frustrated with Contoso Wireless! I've been trying to get my internet up and running for days and I just can't seem to figure it out. Can someone please help me?"

Agent: 
"Hi there, I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble getting your internet set up. How can I help you today?"

Customer: 
"Well, I've been trying to set up my Contoso Wireless internet for days now, but nothing seems to be working. It's really frustrating."

Agent: 
"I understand. We'll do our best to get you up and running as soon as possible. Could you tell me a bit more about the problem? What kind of device are you using?"

Customer: 
"I'm using a Contoso Wireless router, but it doesn't seem to be connecting properly. I've tried resetting it multiple times, but nothing has worked."

Agent: 
"Alright, let's try a few troubleshooting steps to see if we can get it working. First, can you confirm that your router is connected to the power source and modem?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, they're both plugged in and turned on." 

Agent: 
"Ok great. Can you please try rebooting the router by pressing the power button for at least 10 seconds?" 

Customer: 
"I did that already and it didn't work." 

Agent: 
"That's ok. Let's try one more thing. Can you access your router settings page by typing 192.168.1.1 in your web browser?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, I was able to access the settings page." 

Agent: 
"Great! Please go ahead and double-check that your settings are correct according to our website instructions. If everything looks correct, please try restarting the router again and see if that helps." 

Customer: 
"Ok, I'll give it a shot."
