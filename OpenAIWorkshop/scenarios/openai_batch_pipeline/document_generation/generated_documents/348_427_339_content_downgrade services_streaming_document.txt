Customer Service Agent:

Hello, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless customer service. My name is [Name], how may I help you today? 

Customer:

Hi [Name], I have recently downgraded my services from Contoso Wireless and I was wondering if I could still access their streaming product?

Customer Service Agent:

Certainly! When you downgrade your services, you can still access the streaming product. It just won't be as robust as it was with the full package. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer:

Yes, actually. Could you tell me what exactly is included in the streaming product when I downgrade my services? 

Customer Service Agent: 

Sure thing! When you downgrade your services, you will still be able to access our streaming product, which includes unlimited access to movies and TV shows on demand, music streaming, and access to over 1 million radio stations. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: 

That sounds great! What about the cost of the streaming product? Does it change when I downgrade my services? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, the cost of the streaming product does change when you downgrade your services. The price for the streaming product when you downgrade your services is $9.99 per month. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: 
No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help! 

 Customer Service Agent: 
You're welcome! Thank you for choosing Contoso Wireless and have a great day!
