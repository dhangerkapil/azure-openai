Customer: 

"Hello, I am very upset. I recently purchased a product from Contoso Wireless and it is not working. I need some help understanding why it isn't working properly."

Agent: 

"Hello, I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue you're having? Are you able to connect to the device or is it not even turning on?"

Customer: 

"It won't turn on at all. I've tried charging it but that hasn't worked either. It's as if it's completely dead."

Agent: 

"I understand how frustrating this can be. Is this your first time using a Contoso Wireless product?"

Customer: 

"Yes, it is. I thought I was buying a reliable product and now it doesn't work." 

Agent: 

"I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your device. Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about the product before we start troubleshooting?" 

Customer: 

"Well, I read a lot of good reviews about Contoso Wireless products and that's why I decided to buy one. Now I'm starting to think that maybe those reviews were fake or something." 

Agent: 

"I understand how you feel, and we take our customer feedback very seriously here at Contoso Wireless. We strive to provide our customers with the best possible products and service, so let's see what we can do to get your device up and running." 

Customer: 

"Okay, so what do I need to do? How can you help me?" 

Agent: 

"The first step would be to try and reset the device. To do this, hold down the power button for 10 seconds until the device turns off and then try turning it back on again. If this doesn't work, please let me know and we can move on to other possible solutions."
