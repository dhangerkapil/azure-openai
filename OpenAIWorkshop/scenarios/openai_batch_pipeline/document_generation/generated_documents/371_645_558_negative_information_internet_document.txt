Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble with my Contoso Wireless internet. I've been trying to use it for hours and it's not working. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're having difficulty with your Contoso Wireless internet. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue you're having?

Customer: Sure. It's been running slow all day and it won't connect at all now. I've tried restarting the router but nothing seems to work.

Agent: Okay, let's try to get this sorted out. Are you able to connect to the Contoso Wireless network on any of your devices?

Customer: No, none of my devices can connect. It's really frustrating!

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let's start by checking the settings on your router. Is the power cable plugged in correctly?

Customer: Yes, it is. Everything seems to be set up properly.

Agent: Alright, let's try resetting the router then. Please unplug the power cable from the router and wait for 15 seconds before plugging it back in. Once you've done that, please try connecting again and see if that helps resolve the issue. 

Customer: Okay, I did that but it still won't connect. What else can I do? 

Agent: Hmm, let's take a look at the signal strength of your Contoso Wireless network on your device. Please check your device settings and see if the signal strength is strong enough to connect to the internet. 

Customer: It looks like the signal strength is good enough, but I still can't connect to the internet. What else can I do? 

Agent: In that case, let's try updating your device's software and see if that helps resolve the issue. Please open up your device's settings and check if there are any updates available for your device's software or operating system. 

Customer: Okay, I updated my device's software but it still won't connect to the internet! 

Agent: Alright, in that case let me check with our technical team and see if they can help out with this issue. Can you please provide me with some more details about the issue so that I can pass them on to our technical team? 

Customer: Sure, here are some details about my device and router as well as a screenshot of my connection settings - [Attaches screenshot].
