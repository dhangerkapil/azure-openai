"Hi, I'm having some trouble with the streaming service that your company offers. I can't seem to get it to work no matter what I do. Can you help me?"

Agent: 
"Hi there, I understand your frustration and I am here to help. Could you tell me a bit more about the issue you are experiencing with our streaming service?"

Customer: 
"Well, I've been trying to stream a movie for the last hour and it's not working. The screen just says 'loading' and nothing happens."

Agent: 
"I see. Could you please provide me with a few more details so that I can better assist you? What type of device are you using? What is the operating system on the device? Have you tried restarting your device?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I've tried restarting my device multiple times. It's an Android phone with version 8.0 of the operating system."

Agent: 
"Okay, thanks for providing me with that information. Please allow me a few minutes while I investigate this further. In the meantime, could you tell me if there have been any recent updates or changes made to your device or your network settings?"

Customer: 
"No, nothing has changed in the last few days."

Agent: 
"Okay, great. Thank you for confirming that. While I investigate further, could you please provide me with the exact error message that you are receiving when trying to stream the movie?" 

Customer: 
"The error message says 'Error loading media file not found'." 

Agent: 
"Thank you for providing me with that information. Let me look into this further and see what may be causing the issue. In the meantime, could you try accessing our streaming service from another device or from another internet connection? This may help us narrow down the cause of this issue." 

Customer: 
"I don't have another device available right now, but I can try using a different internet connection." 

Agent: 
"That would be great! Please let me know if that helps resolve the issue or if you experience any further problems."
