Customer: Hello, I'm having a problem with my Contoso Wireless TV. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi there! We're here to help. What seems to be the problem with your TV?

Customer: Well, I've had it for a few weeks now and it keeps freezing up. I can't watch anything without it freezing up.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what kind of TV it is?

Customer: It's a Contoso Wireless TV. I bought it just a few weeks ago and now it's not working.

Agent: Okay, let me check into this for you. Is there anything else I can help you with while I look into this?

Customer: Well, the customer service has been terrible so far. I called last week and they said they would call me back, but they never did.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience you've experienced with our customer service team. I'll make sure to look into this and get back to you as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: Yes, actually. How long is the warranty on the Contoso Wireless TV?

Agent: The warranty on the Contoso Wireless TV is one year from the date of purchase. If your TV is within this time frame, we may be able to replace or repair it for you at no cost. 

Customer: That's great! So if I have any other problems within that year, you guys will take care of it? 

Agent: Absolutely! We're here to make sure our customers are happy and taken care of. If you experience any other issues within the warranty period, please don't hesitate to contact us and we'll do our best to help out in any way we can.
