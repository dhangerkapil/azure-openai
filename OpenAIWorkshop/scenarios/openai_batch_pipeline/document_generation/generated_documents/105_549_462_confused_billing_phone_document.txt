Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and I'm confused about my billing. Can you help?

Agent: Absolutely! I'm sorry to hear you're confused about your billing. Can you tell me more about what you're confused about?

Customer: Yes, I purchased a phone last week and was told that I would have a certain amount of data included in my plan. But now when I look at my bill it seems like the data package isn't included.

Agent: It sounds like there may have been some confusion when you purchased your phone. Let me take a look at your account and see if we can figure out what happened. Can you provide me with your account information so I can take a look? 

Customer: Sure, my account number is ######. 

Agent: Thank you for providing your account information. It looks like when you purchased your phone, the data package wasn't included in the plan as part of the promotional offer. Is this correct? 

Customer: No, that's not correct. When I purchased the phone the salesperson told me that the data package was included in the plan. 

Agent: I understand your confusion and apologize for any misunderstanding that may have occurred during the purchase of your phone. We are happy to honor our original promise and include the data package in your plan as part of the promotional offer. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: Yes, could you also explain to me how I can add additional data to my plan if needed? 

Agent: Of course! Adding additional data to your plan is easy and can be done through our website or mobile app. All you need to do is log into your account and select the “additional data” option from the menu. You will then be able to select from a variety of different data packages to add to your plan. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thanks for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! If there is anything else we can do for you please don't hesitate to reach out again. Have a great day!
