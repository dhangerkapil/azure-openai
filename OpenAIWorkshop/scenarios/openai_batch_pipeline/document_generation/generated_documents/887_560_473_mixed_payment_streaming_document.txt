Of course! I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have. How can I help?

Well, I'm a little confused about the payment structure. Is there a subscription fee? 

Agent: 
Yes, there is a monthly subscription fee associated with our streaming product. We offer several different packages, depending on what you're looking for. Do you have any specific questions about the payment options?

Customer: 
Yes, I do. What are the prices for each of the packages?

We have three packages available. The basic package is $10/month, the mid-level package is $15/month and the premium package is $20/month. All packages include access to our full library of content and unlimited streaming. 

Customer: 
That's great to know. Are there any discounts available for students or military personnel? 

Agent: 
Yes, we do offer discounted rates for students and military personnel. Our student discount is 10% off the regular price and our military discount is 15% off the regular price. Both discounts are applied to your monthly subscription fees. 

Customer: 
That's great! Do you offer any other discounts or promotions? 

Agent: 
Yes, we do offer a few other discounts and promotions. We have seasonal promotions that change periodically throughout the year and we also have a referral program where existing customers can get discounts when they refer friends and family to our service. Additionally, if you sign up for an annual subscription, you can get a 10% discount off your total subscription fees. 

Customer: 
That sounds great! Is there anything else I should know about the payment structure?
