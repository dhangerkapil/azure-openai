Hello, I am a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm very dissatisfied with the product phone I purchased. The battery life is incredibly short and it's become increasingly unreliable. I'm considering canceling my service with Contoso Wireless because of this issue. What can you do to help me?

Agent:

Hello there, I apologize for any inconvenience that you have experienced with your product phone. We understand that it can be very frustrating when a device is not working properly and we want to do everything we can to help you. Can you tell me a bit more about the issues you have been having?

Customer: 

Sure, the battery life is incredibly short. It only lasts about 4 hours which is far less than what was promised. And on top of that, the phone has been freezing up and crashing frequently. It's just not reliable enough for me to keep using it.

Agent: 

I completely understand why you're so unhappy with your phone and why you're considering canceling your service with us. We want to make sure that all of our customers are satisfied with their products, so let me see what I can do for you. Are you able to send your phone in for repair? If so, we can take a look at it and see if we can fix the issues you're having.

Customer: 

That would be great! I don't want to have to cancel my service and get a new phone from another company if there's something that can be done to fix my current one. So if I send it in, what happens then? 

Agent: 

Once we receive your phone, our technicians will take a look at it and determine what needs to be done in order to repair it. Depending on the issue, they may need to replace certain parts or they may even be able to upgrade the software on your device. We'll let you know as soon as we have an update on the repair process. 

Customer: 

Okay, that sounds good. How long will this take? 

Agent: 
Unfortunately, it can take up to two weeks for us to repair your phone due to the high volume of repairs we're currently experiencing. Once it's repaired though, we'll ship it back to you as quickly as possible so that you don't have to wait any longer than necessary. Is there anything else I can do for you in the meantime? 

 Customer: 
Yes, is there any way I can get some kind of discount or incentive for having to go through all of this? It seems like a lot of trouble for something that should have worked properly in the first place. 

 Agent: 

 Of course! We'd be more than happy to offer you a discount on your next purchase with us as an apology for the trouble this has caused you. Let me see what kind of options I have available and I'll get back to you with more details soon.
