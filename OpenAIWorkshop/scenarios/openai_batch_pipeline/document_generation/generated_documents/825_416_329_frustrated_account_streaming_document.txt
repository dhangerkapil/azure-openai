Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what kind of issue you're having?

Customer: Yes, I can't seem to stream any of the product. It just keeps buffering and won't play. 

Agent: I understand how frustrating that can be. Can you tell me if this is happening on all devices or just one? 

Customer: All of them. I've tried it on my phone, laptop and tablet, but nothing works. 

Agent: Ok, let's see if we can get this sorted out. Can you tell me what kind of plan you have? 

Customer: I have the unlimited data plan. 

Agent: Great! Let's take a look at your account and see if we can figure out what's going on. Can you provide me with your account information so I can take a look? 

Customer: Sure, here it is [provides account information]. 

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. Let me take a look at your account and see if anything stands out. One moment please...ok, it looks like there may be an issue with your data connection. Can you try resetting your router and see if that helps? 

Customer: Alright, I'll give it a try. 

Agent: Great! Please let me know how it goes and if you need any further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to us again.
