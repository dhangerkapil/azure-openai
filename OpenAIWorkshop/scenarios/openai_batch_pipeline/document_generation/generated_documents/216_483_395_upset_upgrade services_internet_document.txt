Customer: 

Hello, I'm calling about my internet service. It's been incredibly slow for the past few weeks, and I'm getting really frustrated. Can you tell me what's going on?

Agent:

Hi there, my name is [Name], and I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your internet service. Let me see what I can do to help. Are you using Contoso Wireless as your provider?

Customer: 

Yes, that's right. I just don't understand why it's been so slow lately. I've been trying to upgrade my services but nothing seems to be working. 

Agent: 

I understand your frustration. We offer a variety of upgrade options that could help improve your connection speed. Could you tell me more about what kind of service you're looking for?

Customer: 

Well, I'm looking for something faster than what I have now, but not too expensive. Do you have any options that fit that description? 

Agent: 

Yes, we do! We offer a range of upgrade packages that can provide you with faster speeds at an affordable price. For example, our "Gold" package provides speeds up to 25 Mbps for only $50 a month. Would this be something you'd be interested in? 

Customer: 

That sounds perfect! How do I go about signing up for this package? 

Agent: 
Great! All you need to do is log in to your account online and select the "Upgrade" option. From there, you'll be able to select the Gold package and make the necessary payment. Once that's done, your new service should be activated within 24 hours. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

 Customer: 

No, that should do it for now. Thank you for your help!
