Hi, I'm having trouble with my internet service. It's been downgraded recently and I'm not happy about it. Can you tell me why this has happened and what can be done to fix it?

Agent: 

Hello, I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the downgrade in your internet service. I understand how frustrating this can be. Could you please provide some additional details so that I can investigate further?

Customer: 

Sure. I've been with Contoso Wireless for a few months now and my internet speed has always been great. Recently though, my speeds have been much slower and more unreliable than before. It's really been affecting my work, as I need to have a fast connection to be able to do my job properly.

Agent: 

I understand your frustration and apologize again for the inconvenience. Could you tell me what type of internet service plan you have? This information will help me troubleshoot the issue further. 

Customer: 

I'm on the Standard plan which should provide speeds up to 25 Mbps. However, my speed tests are showing that I'm only getting around 5 Mbps at best. 

Agent: 

I apologize for the inconvenience caused by the downgrade in your internet service. Let me look into this further to see what might be causing this issue. In the meantime, please provide me with your account information so that I can investigate further into this matter. 

Customer: 

Sure, my account number is xxxxxxxx and my address is xxxxxxx. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing me with the necessary information. Please allow me a few moments while I look into this further for you.

Based on our investigation, it appears that there was an issue with one of our towers in your area which resulted in a decrease in signal strength and thus slower speeds than usual. We are currently working on resolving this issue and expect that your speeds should return back to normal shortly. We apologize again for any inconvenience caused by this issue. 

Customer: 
That's good to hear - thank you for looking into it for me. Is there anything else I need to do or should I just wait for the speeds to return back to normal? 

Agent: 
No need to do anything else - just wait for the speeds to return back to normal as we work on resolving the issue from our end. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
