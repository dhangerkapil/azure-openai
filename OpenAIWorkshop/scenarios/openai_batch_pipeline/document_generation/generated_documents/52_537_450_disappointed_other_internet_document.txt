Agent: Hi there, I apologize that you are not satisfied with the product. Please allow me to assist you in getting to the bottom of this issue. Could you tell me more about what is causing your dissatisfaction?

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. Let me take a look at what might be causing this issue. Could you provide me with your account information so I can investigate further?

Customer: Sure, my account number is 123456789.

Agent: Thank you for providing your account information. I will look into this right away and get back to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, can you tell me more about the type of internet product you purchased?

Customer: Yes, it was the basic internet package from Contoso Wireless. It was supposed to provide speeds up to 10 Mbps, but it rarely ever reaches that speed.

Agent: I understand your frustration with the speeds not meeting expectations. Let me investigate this further and see if there are any adjustments that need to be made to your account in order to improve performance. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today? 

Customer: Yes, actually. Can you explain why my internet connection is so unreliable? It cuts out multiple times a day and it's really frustrating! 

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. I will look into this right away and get back to you as soon as possible with an update on what might be causing this issue. In the meantime, please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help. 

Agent: You're welcome! Please do not hesitate to reach out if there is anything else we can do for you today or in the future. Have a great day!
