Customer: I recently purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and I'm having some issues with it.

Agent: Hi there, my name is Sarah and I'm with Contoso Wireless customer service. How can I help you today?

Customer: Well, I purchased the phone two days ago and it's been acting strange. It keeps freezing and lagging, and the battery life is terrible. I want to know what I can do to fix this issue.

Agent: That's certainly not ideal. Can you tell me what model phone you purchased?

Customer: Yes, it's the new Contoso Wireless Pro-X model. 

Agent: Alright, let me take a look at that. Can you tell me a bit more about the issues you're having? 

Customer: Sure. As I mentioned, the phone keeps freezing and lagging, especially when I'm trying to do something like play a game or watch a video. Also, the battery life is really bad; it drains within an hour or two of use. 

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. We'll need to investigate further in order to determine what may be causing the issue. In the meantime, are you able to provide me with your order number so we can look up your purchase? 

Customer: Yes, my order number is XYZ1234567890. 

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. Let me take a few moments to look up your purchase and see if we can determine what may be causing the issue with your phone. 

Customer: Ok, thank you.
