Customer: Hi, I'm having a billing issue with my Contoso Wireless phone. Can you help?

Agent: Hi there! Of course I can help you with your billing issue. Could you tell me more about it?

Customer: I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless phone and I'm being charged for services that I didn't sign up for. I don't understand why this is happening. 

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me what services you were charged for? 

Customer: Yes, it's saying I was charged for international calling, extra data, and text messaging. 

Agent: Alright, let me take a look at your account. Please provide me with your account number so that I can better assist you. 

Customer: Sure, my account number is XXXXXXXXXX. 

Agent: Thank you. Let me take a look at your account now. Give me just one moment please.

Agent: Alright, it looks like these services were automatically added to your plan when you purchased the phone. It's part of our standard package for all new phones. Unfortunately we can't remove the charges from your bill, but we can give you a discount on them if you'd like. 

Customer: That doesn't make any sense! Why would these services be added without my consent? 

Agent: We understand that this may be an inconvenience, but the services are part of our standard package and are included in the price of the phone. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused. We can offer you a discount on the services if that would help? 

Customer: No, that won't help. I still feel like this isn't right and I don't want to pay for something that I didn't ask for or agree to pay for in the first place. 

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from and we apologize again for any confusion or inconvenience this has caused. Is there anything else we can do to help?
