Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that your Contoso Wireless TV isn't working. We take great pride in providing our customers with quality products and service, so I'd be happy to help. Can you tell me what's happening?

Customer: Well, I plugged it in and the power light came on, but the screen is black. Nothing else is happening.

Agent: Okay, that's strange. Have you tried unplugging the power cord from the wall and plugging it back in again?

Customer: Yes, I've done that twice already and nothing has changed.

Agent: Alright, I understand. Have you tried resetting the TV? To do this, press and hold the power button on the remote for 10 seconds. Then release the button and wait for the TV to reboot.

Customer: Yes, I did that as well but still nothing happened. 

Agent: Hmm...I see. Let me check something else for you then. Can you please provide me with the model number of your TV? That will help me figure out what might be going on. 

Customer: Sure, it's a Contoso Wireless 55-inch 4K Ultra HD LED Smart TV Model# CWTV55UHDLSTV. 

Agent: Got it! Please give me one moment while I check something out for you.

Agent: Okay, after looking into this issue further, it appears that we recently released a firmware update for this model of TV that needs to be installed in order for it to work properly. Unfortunately, this information was not included in our packaging or product description when you purchased it, so we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. 

Customer: Well that's really disappointing! Is there any way to get the update now? 

Agent: Absolutely! You can download the firmware update from our website at contosowireless.com/firmware-updates/. Once you've downloaded it, simply follow the instructions on the page to install it onto your TV and that should resolve the issue. If not, please don't hesitate to reach out to us again and we'll be more than happy to help further troubleshoot the problem with you. 

Customer: Alright, thanks for your help! I'll give this a try and hopefully my TV will be up and running soon! 

Agent: You're welcome! Please let us know if there's anything else we can do for you today. Have a great day!
