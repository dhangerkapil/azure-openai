Hello, I'm interested in upgrading my current Contoso Wireless services. Specifically, I'm looking for more information on the Contoso Wireless TV product. Can you help me out?

Agent: 
Of course! I'd be more than happy to answer any questions you may have about Contoso Wireless TV. What would you like to know?

Customer: 
What kind of features does the Contoso Wireless TV product offer?

Agent: 
The Contoso Wireless TV product offers a wide range of features, including access to over 500 channels, including all major networks, HD and 4K programming, and on-demand movies and shows. You'll also get access to our cloud-based DVR service, which allows you to record your favorite shows and watch them later. Plus, with our mobile app, you can take your favorite shows with you on the go. 

Customer: 
That sounds great! How much does it cost to upgrade my services? 

Agent: 
The cost of upgrading your services depends on the package you choose. Our basic package is $50 per month, while our premium package is $100 per month. Both packages include the same features, but the premium package includes additional benefits such as free installation and a free DVR box. 

Customer: 
What kind of installation is included in the upgrade? 

Agent: 
Our professional technicians will come to your home or office and install all necessary equipment for your Contoso Wireless TV service. This includes mounting your TV on the wall, running cables through your walls or attic, connecting your devices to the network, and setting up the DVR box. The installation process usually takes about two hours. 

Customer: 
Do I need any special equipment for the upgrade? 

Agent: 
No special equipment is needed for the upgrade; however, you may need a compatible device such as a smart TV or streaming device in order to access all of our features. We also recommend having an internet connection with at least 10 Mbps download speed in order to get the most out of our service. If you don't have a compatible device or fast enough internet connection, we can provide both at an additional cost. 

Customer: 
That sounds good! Is there anything else I should know before upgrading my services? 

Agent: 
Yes! Before upgrading your services, we recommend that you check out our website for more information about our different packages and features. We also have a customer support team available 24/7 if you ever have any questions or need help troubleshooting an issue.
