Customer:
Hello, I'm having some trouble with Contoso Wireless. I recently downgraded my plan to the basic package and I'm not sure if I'm still eligible for product streaming. Could you please help me? 

Agent:
Hello there, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. I apologize for any confusion you may have experienced. Can you please tell me more about the product streaming you are inquiring about? 

Customer:
Yes, I was told that when I upgraded to the basic package, I would still be able to stream certain products like movies and music. Is that correct? 

Agent:
Yes, that is correct. Customers who have downgraded their plans will still be able to stream certain products like movies and music. However, there are some restrictions and limitations associated with this service. Can you tell me more about what type of streaming you were looking for? 

Customer:
Well, I mainly wanted to be able to stream movies on my phone or laptop. Is that still possible with the basic package? 

Agent:
Yes, it is still possible to stream movies on your phone or laptop with the basic package. However, please note that due to the restrictions associated with this package, there may be some limitations on the number of movies you can stream at a time or the quality of the movies available for streaming. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer:
Yes, actually I was also wondering if there were any discounts available for streaming services with the basic package? 

Agent:
Unfortunately, we do not offer any discounts or promotions specifically for streaming services with our basic packages at this time. However, we do offer several different promotions and discounts throughout the year which may apply to streaming services as well. Can I answer any other questions for you today? 

Customer: 
No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help! 

Agent: 
You're welcome! Thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless and have a great day!
