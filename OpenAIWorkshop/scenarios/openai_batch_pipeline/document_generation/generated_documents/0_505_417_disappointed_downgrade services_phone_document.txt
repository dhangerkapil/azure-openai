Hi, I'm having an issue with my phone. I'm not happy with the service I'm getting and I'd like to downgrade my plan.

I apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced. Can you tell me more about what kind of phone you're using?

Yes, it's a Contoso Wireless phone. I've been on the same plan for a while now and it's just not cutting it anymore. I'd like to downgrade my plan.

I understand. We do have several options for downgrading your plan that may better suit your needs. Would you like to hear more about them? 

Customer: 
Yes, please.
