Agent: Hi there! I'm glad you're looking to downgrade your service with us. We do have some options for downgrading your product TV. Could you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for?

Customer: Sure, I was looking to save money but still get decent service. Is there anything that could provide me with that?

Agent: Absolutely! We have several packages that can offer you good service at a lower cost. What kind of channels and features were you hoping to get with the product TV? 

Customer: Hmm, I guess around 50-60 channels, no sports or premium channels. Just the basics. 

Agent: Okay, we can definitely help you out with that. We have a package that includes 60 channels of basic cable and no sports or premium channels. It's also significantly cheaper than our other packages. Would this be something that interests you? 

Customer: That sounds great, but is there any way to get even more savings? 

Agent: Yes, there is! We do offer an additional discount if you bundle the product TV with another one of our services. For example, if you choose to bundle it with our internet service, you can get an additional 10% off your total bill each month. Would this be something you'd be interested in? 

Customer: Definitely! That sounds like a great deal. Could you tell me more about the internet service and what it includes? 

Agent: Absolutely! Our internet service offers up to 100Mbps download speeds and unlimited data usage so you can stream and surf as much as you want without worrying about running out of data or experiencing any slowdowns. Does this sound like something that would fit your needs? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds perfect! Is there anything else I should know before I make my decision? 

Agent: Yes, we also offer 24/7 customer support in case you ever have any questions or issues with the service. Does this sound like something that would work for you? 

Customer: Yes, it does! Can I go ahead and sign up for the bundle now? 

Agent: Absolutely! I'll be happy to help walk you through the process and answer any questions you may have along the way. Let's go ahead and get started!
