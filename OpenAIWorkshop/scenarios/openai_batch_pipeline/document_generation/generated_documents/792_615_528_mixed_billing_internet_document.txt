Customer: Hi Jane. I recently signed up for the Contoso Wireless internet service and I’m having some issues with my bill. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely. What seems to be the problem?

Customer: Well, I got my first bill and it seems to be way more than what I was expecting. Can you explain why it’s so high?

Customer Service Agent: Sure. It looks like there was a one-time installation fee that was added to your first bill. It’s a standard fee that we charge for setting up new accounts. 

Customer: That’s a bit of a surprise. Can you tell me how much it was?

Customer Service Agent: Yes, the installation fee was $99. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your bill?

Customer: Yes, actually. My bill also says that I owe for a modem rental fee. What is this fee for? 

Customer Service Agent: The modem rental fee is a monthly charge that covers the cost of the modem we provide you with when you sign up for our internet service. 

Customer: That makes sense. But why do I have to pay for it if I already have my own modem? 

Customer Service Agent: Unfortunately, we don’t allow customers to use their own modems with our service. All customers must rent one of our modems in order to get internet service from us. The rental fee is $9.99 per month and is added to your bill each month until you cancel your service with us. 

Customer: Okay, so it looks like I’m paying an extra $109 this month due to the installation and modem rental fees. Is there any way I can get these fees waived or reduced? 

Customer Service Agent: Unfortunately, we don’t have any promotions or discounts available at this time that would waive or reduce those fees. However, I can offer you a one-time credit of $50 on your account if you agree to sign up for auto-pay for your monthly bills going forward. 

Customer: That sounds great! I’ll take the credit and sign up for auto-pay right away. Thanks for all your help Jane! 

Customer Service Agent: You’re welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
