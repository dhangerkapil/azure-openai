Hello, I'm not happy with the service I'm getting from Contoso Wireless. I recently downgraded my service and I'm not getting what I expected. Can you explain why this happened?

Agent: 

Hello, I apologize for the issue you're experiencing with your service. We understand that it can be frustrating to downgrade your service. Can you provide us with some details about your account so we can better assist you?

Customer: 

Sure, my name is John Smith and my account number is 1234567890.

Agent: 

Thank you for the information, John. We appreciate your patience while we look into your account. After reviewing your account, it appears that when you downgraded your service, you did not select the proper package for your needs. Is this correct?

Customer: 

Yes, that's right. What other products do you offer that might better suit my needs? 

Agent: 

We offer several different packages depending on what type of usage you plan on having. Are you looking for a plan that offers more data or unlimited talk and text? 

Customer: 

I need more data but I don't want to pay too much. Do you have any plans that offer a good amount of data at an affordable price? 

Agent: 

Yes, we do have plans that offer a good amount of data at an affordable price. We currently have a plan that offers 10GB of data for $50 per month. Does this sound like something that would work for you? 

 Customer: 

 That sounds great! How long does this plan last? 

 Agent: 

 The 10GB plan lasts for 30 days and will automatically renew at the end of each month unless you decide to cancel or change your plan. Does this sound like something that would work for you?
