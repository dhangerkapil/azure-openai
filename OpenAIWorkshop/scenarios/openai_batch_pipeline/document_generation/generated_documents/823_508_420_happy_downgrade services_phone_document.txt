Customer: Hi, I'm looking to downgrade my services with Contoso Wireless. I have a product phone that I need help with.

Agent: Hello! How can I help you with your product phone?

Customer: Well, I've had the phone for about a year and it's not performing as well as it used to. I'm thinking about downgrading my services so I can get a new one.

Agent: Sure, we can definitely help you with that. Is there anything else you would like to know about downgrading your services?

Customer: Yeah, what are the benefits of downgrading my services? 

Agent: Downgrading your services will allow you to get a new phone at a discounted rate. You will also get additional discounts on your monthly bill and free upgrades on select products and services. 

Customer: That sounds great! How do I go about downgrading my services? 

Agent: First, you'll need to decide which plan you'd like to downgrade to. We have a variety of plans available, ranging from basic talk and text plans to more advanced data-based plans. Once you've decided on the plan you want, you can contact our customer service team and they'll be able to help you switch your service over. 

Customer: OK, great! What about the phone? Will I still be able to keep it? 

Agent: Yes, you will still be able to keep your phone if you decide to downgrade your services. However, if you decide that you'd like a new phone instead, we can offer you discounted rates on select models when you switch plans. 

Customer: That sounds perfect! One more question - what kind of customer service do you offer for downgrading my services? 

Agent: Our customer service team is available 24/7 and can help answer any questions or concerns that may arise when switching plans. We also offer free tech support for any issues related to your product phone or other devices connected to your account.
