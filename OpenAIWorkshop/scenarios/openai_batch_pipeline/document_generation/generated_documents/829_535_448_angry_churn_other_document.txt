"I am so angry! I just found out that Contoso Wireless is increasing the price of their product, and I'm not happy about it. I'm looking for other options and I want to know what else is out there!"

Agent:
"I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We understand your concerns and we are here to help you find an alternative solution that fits your needs. Could you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for?"

Customer: 
"I want something similar to what Contoso Wireless offers, but at a better price. And I want to make sure that the product is reliable and of good quality."

Agent: 
"We understand that cost is an important factor when it comes to selecting a wireless provider. Let me see what we can do to help you find the best option. Can you tell me more about your current service plan with Contoso Wireless?" 

Customer: 
"I've been with them for two years now, but I'm not satisfied with their product. The service has been spotty and the customer service isn't great either. It's just not worth the money." 

Agent: 
"I'm sorry to hear that. We take customer satisfaction very seriously here at Contoso Wireless, and we would like to make sure you get the best product at a reasonable cost. What kind of features are you looking for in a new service plan?" 

Customer: 
"I need unlimited data, good coverage, and preferably no contracts. Also, I'd like a competitive price." 

Agent: 
"We can definitely work with that. Let me see what we have available for you. Are there any other features that you would like in a wireless plan?" 

Customer: 
"Well, I'd like to be able to use my phone while traveling internationally, so if there's an option for that it would be great." 

Agent: 
"We do have plans available that include international roaming capabilities. Let me check on the details and see if it's something that would work for you."
