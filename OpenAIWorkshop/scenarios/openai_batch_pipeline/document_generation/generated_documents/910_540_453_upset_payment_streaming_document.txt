Customer: 

"Hello, I'm having a problem with my payment for the Contoso Wireless streaming service. I signed up for it a few days ago and now it's saying my payment isn't going through. Can you help me out with this?"

Agent: 

"Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your payment. Could you please provide me with your account information so I can take a look?"

Customer: 

"Sure, my account number is *****-*****-*****. I just want to make sure I'm able to access the streaming service without any further issues."

Agent: 

"No problem. Let me take a look here. It looks like your payment was declined because there were insufficient funds in the account associated with the payment method. Is there another payment method you'd like to use?"

Customer: 

"Yes, I'd like to switch to a different payment method. Is there anything else I need to do besides provide the new payment information?"

Agent: 

"Yes, you'll need to update the payment information in your account settings. Once that's done, we can process the new payment and you should be able to access the streaming service without any issues."

Customer: 

"Okay, got it. So what happens if my payment is declined again?" 

Agent: 

"If your payment is declined again, we will reach out to you via email or phone and ask for an alternate payment method. We'll also provide you with more information on how to update your account settings." 

Customer: 
"Okay, that makes sense. Is there anything else I should know about the streaming service before I start using it?" 
Agent: 

"Yes, there are a few things you should be aware of before using the streaming service. First, make sure your device meets the minimum requirements for streaming content. Second, be sure to read our terms of service and privacy policy so that you understand how your data is used and protected. Finally, please remember that we offer limited customer support for streaming related issues."
