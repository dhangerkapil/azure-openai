I have looked into the issue and it appears that your account settings need to be updated in order to access the streaming service. Would you like me to walk you through the process of updating your settings?

No problem! Let's start by accessing your account settings page on our website. Once there, you will need to select the option for streaming services and then make sure all of the required settings are enabled and correct. Once this is done, you should be able to access the streaming service without any issues. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
