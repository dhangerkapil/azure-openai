Customer: Hi, I'm having some trouble with the internet on my Contoso Wireless phone. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you with your Contoso Wireless internet issue. Can you tell me more about what's happening?

Customer: Sure. Whenever I try to use the internet on my phone, it keeps saying that there's no connection. I've tried resetting the network settings, but it didn't work. 

Agent: That's strange. Could you please tell me what type of phone you have and which version of the Contoso Wireless software you are using? 

Customer: It's a Samsung Galaxy S10+ and the version is 8.0. 

Agent: Alright, let me take a look at that for you. Can you please tell me which network you are trying to connect to? 

Customer: I'm trying to connect to the Contoso Wireless 4G network. 

Agent: Okay, let me try something here. Please go to your phone's Settings menu and then select Wi-Fi and make sure that it is enabled. Then, select your Contoso Wireless network from the list of available networks and enter your password if necessary. 

Customer: Okay, I did all of that and still nothing is happening. 

Agent: Alright, let's try one more thing before we move on to more complex troubleshooting steps. Please go back into the Settings menu and select Network & Internet, then Cellular Networks, then Advanced Calling and make sure that VoLTE is enabled. 

Customer: Alright, I did that and now it seems to be working! Thank you so much for your help! 

Agent: You're very welcome! If there's anything else I can do for you or if you have any other questions about your Contoso Wireless service, please don't hesitate to let me know!
