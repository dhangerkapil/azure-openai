Customer:
Hello, I'm calling to inquire about upgrading my Contoso Wireless phone. I'm very angry because I was supposed to receive an upgrade discount, but it never came through. Can you help me?

Agent:
Good afternoon, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. I apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced. Let me see what I can do to help. Can you provide me with your account information and the phone model you would like to upgrade?

Customer:
Yes, my account number is 84567. I'd like to upgrade to the latest model of the Contoso Wireless phone.

Agent:
Excellent. Let me check to see if there is an upgrade discount available for that phone model. Please give me one moment while I look into this for you. 

Customer:
Ok, but hurry up. I've already been waiting too long for this upgrade. 

Agent:
I understand your frustration, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. We will do our best to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. According to our records, it looks like there is a 10% discount available for your upgrade. Is there anything else I can do for you today? 

Customer:
Yes! How much longer until I get my new phone? The wait time has been ridiculous! 

Agent: 
I apologize again for the delay in your upgrade. We are currently experiencing a high volume of orders due to the release of our new phone model and it may take a few days before your order is processed and shipped out. We will send you an email when your order has been shipped out and provide you with tracking information so that you can monitor its progress. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: 
No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help. 

Agent: 
You're welcome! Thank you for choosing Contoso Wireless and have a great day!
