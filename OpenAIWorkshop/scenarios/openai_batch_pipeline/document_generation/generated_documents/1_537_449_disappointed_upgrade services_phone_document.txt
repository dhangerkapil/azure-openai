Good morning, I am having trouble with my phone. I have been a loyal customer of Contoso Wireless for some time now, but I feel like I'm not getting the best service when it comes to upgrading my phone. Can you help me? 

Agent:
Good morning, thank you for being a loyal customer of Contoso Wireless! I'm happy to help you with any questions or concerns you have regarding upgrading your phone. How can I help? 

Customer:
Well, I was hoping to upgrade my phone but when I called in to check my eligibility, I was told that I don't qualify for an upgrade. Is there anything else that can be done? 

Agent:
I understand your frustration. We want our customers to be able to upgrade their phones when they're eligible. Let me take a look at your account and see what we can do. Can you provide me with your account number? 

Customer: 
Yes, here it is [Account Number]. 

Agent: 
Thank you. Give me just one moment while I take a look at your account.

Agent: 
Ok, so it looks like you are eligible for an upgrade after all! All you need to do is call our customer service line and they will walk you through the process. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: 
That's great news! Thank you so much for helping me out. One more question - what type of phone should I get? Are there any new models that have been released recently that would be a good fit for me? 

Agent: 
Absolutely! We recently released a new model called the Contoso Lite which is a great choice if you're looking for something lightweight and powerful. It has a 5-inch display and runs on the latest version of our operating system. It's also very affordable, so it's a great choice if you're on a budget. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: 
No, that should do it. Thanks again for all your help!
