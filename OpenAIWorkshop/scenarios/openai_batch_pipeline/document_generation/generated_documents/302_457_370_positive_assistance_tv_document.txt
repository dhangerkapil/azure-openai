Customer: Hi there! I am having trouble with my Contoso Wireless TV. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi, I’d be more than happy to help you out. What seems to be the problem?

Customer: Well, I just got the TV and it won’t turn on. I’ve tried plugging it in, but nothing is happening.

Agent: Alright, let’s see if we can get this figured out. Is the power cord securely connected to both the outlet and the back of the TV?

Customer: Yes, it is. I checked it twice.

Agent: Okay, that’s good. Is there any indication of power? Any LED lights or anything like that? 

Customer: Yes, there is an LED light on the front of the TV that indicates power is connected. 

Agent: Alright, that’s good. Is there a remote control that came with your Contoso Wireless TV? 

Customer: Yes, there is a remote control. 

Agent: Great! Could you please try using the remote to turn on your TV? 

Customer: Okay, sure. Hmm...it looks like it worked! The TV is on now. 

Agent: That’s great news! It looks like we got it working for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, thank you so much for your help! You were really helpful and I really appreciate it. 

Agent: You’re very welcome! If you have any other issues or questions in the future don’t hesitate to reach out to us at Contoso Wireless again. Have a great day!
