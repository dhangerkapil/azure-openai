Hello, I'm looking for some support regarding the Contoso Wireless product. I recently purchased it and have been having some issues with it. Can you help?

Agent:

Good morning! Thank you for reaching out to Contoso Wireless for support. I am more than happy to assist you with any issues you may be having. Could you please provide me with a bit more information about what type of issue you are experiencing?

Customer:

Yes, sure. Well, the product I bought was supposed to provide me with a secure connection, but it's not working as advertised. Every time I try to connect to the network, it keeps dropping out or is incredibly slow.

Agent: 

I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Can you please tell me which device and operating system you are using when trying to connect? This will help us troubleshoot the issue further. 

Customer: 

I'm using an iPhone 8 Plus and iOS 11.4.1. 

Agent: 

Thank you for providing that information. We will need to run a few tests to determine the cause of your connection issues. Could you please provide me with your account details so we can begin? 

Customer: 

Yes, my account details are [account details]. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing your account information. We will now run some tests to determine the cause of your connection issues. In the meantime, could you please tell me what other features of our product are important to you? 

Customer: 
Well, I'm mostly concerned about getting a secure connection and good reception in my area. But I'd also like some additional features like being able to stream music or video without interruption and access to international roaming plans if possible. 

Agent: 
Understood. We will do our best to ensure that all of these features are available to you once we have resolved your connection issues. In the meantime, could you please confirm that your device is compatible with our product?
