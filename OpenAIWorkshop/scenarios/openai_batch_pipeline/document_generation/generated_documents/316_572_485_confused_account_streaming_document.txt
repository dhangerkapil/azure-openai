Agent: Hi there, I apologize for the inconvenience. We're here to help. Can you tell me a bit more about what's happening?

Customer: Sure, when I try to stream the movie it just says "loading" and nothing happens. It's been like this for a while now.

Agent: Okay, let's try a few things. First, can you confirm that you're using the correct username and password for your account?

Customer: Yes, I'm positive that I'm using the correct credentials. 

Agent: Alright, let's try clearing your browser cache and cookies. Can you do that and then try streaming again?

Customer: Sure, I'll give it a try. 

Agent: Great! After you've done that, can you let me know if the issue persists? 

Customer: Yes, will do. 

[The customer clears their cache and cookies and attempts to stream again.] 

Customer: Okay, I've done that but it still isn't working. 

Agent: Hmm, that's strange. Can you try restarting your device? That may help fix the issue. 

Customer: Sure, I'll give it a shot. 

[The customer restarts their device and attempts to stream again.] 

Customer: Alright, that didn't work either. Is there anything else I can try? 

Agent: Yes, there is one more thing we can try before escalating the issue to our technical support team. Can you please check if your device has the latest version of the Contoso Wireless app installed? That might be causing the problem. 

Customer: Sure, let me check that now. 
[The customer checks their device for updates.] 
Customer: Alright, looks like my app is up to date. What now? 

Agent: Let me double check with our technical support team and see if they have any other suggestions for you. In the meantime, can you provide me with your account information so I can look into this further? 

 Customer: Of course! Here is my account information....
