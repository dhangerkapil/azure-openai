Customer: Hi, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I need some help understanding the different levels of streaming services you offer.

Agent: Hi there! We're happy to help. Our streaming services offer a variety of options for customers to choose from. Would you like me to explain the different levels?

Customer: Yes, please. I'm confused about what's included in each service.

Agent: Sure. We offer three different levels of streaming services - Basic, Standard, and Premium. 

Basic includes access to our standard library of content with up to 480p resolution. 
Standard includes access to our standard library plus some premium content with up to 720p resolution. 
Premium includes access to our entire library plus all premium content with up to 1080p resolution. 

Customer: Okay, so if I want access to the highest quality content then I need the Premium service?

Agent: Yes, that's correct. The Premium service offers the highest quality streaming experience with access to all our content in 1080p resolution. 

Customer: What if I want to downgrade my service? Can I do that? 

Agent: Absolutely! You can downgrade your service at any time by simply selecting a lower tier of streaming service in your account settings. You will be billed at the new rate for the current month and your subscription will renew at the new rate after that. 

Customer: Okay, so if I downgrade my service now then I won't be charged for the higher tier anymore? 

Agent: That's correct! Your subscription will be adjusted and you'll only be billed at the new rate going forward. However, please keep in mind that if you decide to upgrade your service again later on, you'll be charged at the current rate for that tier. 

Customer: Alright, that makes sense. One last question - is there any way to get a discount if I decide to downgrade my service? 

Agent: We do offer occasional promotional discounts for our streaming services, so please keep an eye out for those! We also offer loyalty rewards for customers who have been with us for a long time - you can check your account settings or contact us directly for more information on that.
