Customer Service Agent: Hi, my name is [Name], and I'm a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How may I help you? 

Customer: Hi. I'm having some trouble with the internet service I bought from Contoso Wireless. It's been slow and unreliable, and I don't understand why.

Customer Service Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about the problem?

Customer: Sure. The internet connection has been very slow, sometimes taking minutes to load a single page. And it's been going on for days now.

Customer Service Agent: That does sound like an issue. Can you tell me what kind of device you're using to access the internet? 

Customer: It's an iPhone XR. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let me check our records to see if there are any issues with your account or with our network in your area. One moment please. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, it looks like there have been some reported issues in your area that may be causing your slow connection speeds. We're working on resolving those issues as soon as possible, but in the meantime I can provide you with some tips to help improve your connection speed. 

Customer: That would be great. What kind of tips do you have? 

Customer Service Agent: Well, the first thing you can do is to check the signal strength of your connection by going into the settings on your device and checking the signal bars. If they are low, then try moving closer to the router or modem or changing its position if possible. You can also try resetting your router or modem by unplugging it and plugging it back in after a few minutes. This should help improve your connection speeds as well as reliability. Finally, if none of these steps work, then please contact us again so we can further investigate this issue for you. 

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. I'll give those tips a try and see if it helps. Thank you for your help! 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
