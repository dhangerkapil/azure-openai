"I'm so frustrated with your internet service! It's been down for over 24 hours and I still can't get it back up. I need answers now!"

Contoso Wireless Agent: 

"I apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced. We take our customer service very seriously and are dedicated to providing the best internet service possible. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on with your connection?"

Customer: 

"It just stopped working yesterday morning and hasn't been back up since then. I've tried rebooting my router, but nothing has worked. This is unacceptable!"

Contoso Wireless Agent: 

"I understand how frustrating this must be. We're doing our best to identify the issue and get it resolved as quickly as possible. Can you tell me what type of router you are using?"

Customer: 

"It's an Arris SURFboard SBG7580-AC. I bought it about a year ago, so it should still be relatively new."

Contoso Wireless Agent: 

"That's good to know. We'll look into the issue with your router and see if that could be causing the problem with your internet connection. In the meantime, have you tried resetting your modem as well?" 

Customer: 

"Yes, I did that yesterday but nothing changed." 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 

"Alright, I understand. We'll look into this further and contact you as soon as we have an update on the issue. In the meantime, is there anything else we can do to help make this process smoother for you?" 

Customer: 

"Yes, I would like to know when I can expect this to be fixed. 24 hours without internet is too long." 
 
Contoso Wireless Agent: 
 
"We are doing our best to resolve this issue as quickly as possible and will contact you as soon as we have an update. In the meantime, would you like us to provide you with a temporary solution while we work on getting your connection back up?"
