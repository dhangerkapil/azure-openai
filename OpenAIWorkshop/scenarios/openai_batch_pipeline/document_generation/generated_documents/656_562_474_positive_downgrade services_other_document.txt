Customer: Hi, I'm interested in learning more about the downgrade services that Contoso Wireless offers. Can you tell me more?

Agent: Hi there! I'm happy to provide you with more information about our downgrade services. We offer a variety of different plans that can be tailored to your individual needs. Can I ask what kind of phone you currently have?

Customer: Yes, I have an iPhone 8.

Agent: Great! We offer a range of services specifically designed for iPhone 8 users. Our basic plan includes unlimited data and 500 minutes of talk time for just $20 per month. We also offer an upgraded plan that includes unlimited talk time and 1GB of data for $30 per month. 

Customer: That sounds great! Can I add additional features to either plan?

Agent: Absolutely! You can add additional features such as international calling, text messaging, and data packages for an additional fee. 

Customer: Do you offer any discounts or promotions for signing up for your service?

Agent: Yes, we do! We are currently offering a 20% discount on our basic plan when you sign up for a 12-month contract. 

Customer: That's fantastic! Can I get the same discount if I sign up for the upgraded plan? 

Agent: Yes, you can! You will receive the same 20% discount when you sign up for a 12-month contract on our upgraded plan as well. 

Customer: Perfect! Is there anything else I should know before signing up? 

Agent: We do recommend that you read through our Terms and Conditions before signing up to make sure that our service is right for you. You can find them on our website or in any of our retail stores.
