Customer: "I've been trying to contact Contoso Wireless customer service for days. I'm having a huge issue with my phone and I need help right away!"

Agent: "I apologize for the delay. How can I help you today?"

Customer: "I got the new Contoso Wireless phone and it has been nothing but trouble since day one. It keeps freezing up and won't respond to anything I do!"

Agent: "I apologize for the inconvenience. We take pride in providing quality products and support. Could you please provide me with some additional details about the phone and the issues you are experiencing?"

Customer: "I've had it for about a week now. It won't let me make calls, send texts, or access any of my apps. The screen just freezes up and nothing works."

Agent: "Okay, I understand. Have you tried restarting your phone? That may help resolve the issue."

Customer: "Yes, I've tried restarting it multiple times and nothing has worked. I just want my phone to work properly like it should!"

Agent: "I understand your frustration. We are here to help you resolve this issue as quickly as possible. Let's try a few more things before we proceed with any further steps." 

Customer: "What else can I do? I'm running out of patience here." 

Agent: "Let's try resetting your phone to its factory settings. This will erase all of your data, so make sure you back up any important files before we proceed. Once that is done, please let me know so we can move on to the next step." 

Customer: "Alright, I'll do that now." 

Agent: "Great! Please let me know when you have finished backing up your data and we can proceed with the reset process."
