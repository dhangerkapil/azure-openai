Customer: I recently received my first bill from Contoso Wireless and it was much higher than I expected. What's going on?

Agent: Hi there! Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Can you please provide me with your account number so that I can take a closer look at your bill? 

Customer: Sure, it's 09876.

Agent: Thank you for that information. I'm looking into your account now and it appears that the additional charge is due to your subscription to the Contoso Wireless streaming service. Are you familiar with the product?

Customer: No, I'm not. What exactly is this streaming service?

Agent: The streaming service is a subscription-based video streaming platform that allows customers to access thousands of movies, TV shows, and other entertainment content from their Contoso Wireless device. It's available for an additional monthly fee of $10. 

Customer: That's ridiculous! Why wasn't I informed about this extra cost when I signed up for Contoso Wireless? 

Agent: We apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused you. We do make customers aware of all additional fees during the signup process, however it appears that this may have been missed in your case. We will be sure to update our signup process to ensure that customers are fully aware of any additional fees before signing up. 

Customer: That doesn't help me now. Can I get a refund for the additional fee I was charged? 

Agent: Unfortunately we cannot provide refunds on streaming service subscriptions, as the cost is non-refundable once the service has been activated. However, if you would like to cancel your subscription and avoid any further charges, we can certainly do that for you. 

Customer: Okay, fine. Please cancel my subscription then. But what about the fee that I was already charged? Can't you do something about that? 

Agent: We understand how frustrating this must be for you and we apologize for any inconvenience caused by the extra charge on your bill. Unfortunately we cannot provide refunds on streaming service subscriptions, however we can offer you a one-time credit in the amount of $5 as a gesture of goodwill. 

Customer: That's still not enough to cover what I was charged but it's better than nothing. I guess I'll take it. 

Agent: Great! We'll go ahead and apply the credit to your account right away and you should see it reflected in your next bill statement. Is there anything else we can help you with today?
