Customer: Hi, I have a question about the Contoso Wireless internet product. 

Agent: Hello! How can I help you with Contoso Wireless today? 

Customer: I'm interested in getting the internet service but I'm wondering if I can make payments in installments? 

Agent: Absolutely! We offer several payment plans to our customers. Which option would you prefer? 

Customer: Can you tell me more about those options? 

Agent: Of course! We have three payment plans to choose from - the monthly plan, the semi-annual plan, and the annual plan. The monthly plan allows you to pay for your service on a monthly basis, while the semi-annual and annual plans allow you to make one lump-sum payment for 6 or 12 months of service, respectively. All plans are subject to a one-time setup fee. 

Customer: That sounds great. Can you tell me more about the fees associated with each plan? 

Agent: Sure! The monthly plan has no additional fees aside from the setup fee and regular monthly payments. For the semi-annual and annual plans, there is an additional discount of 10% and 15%, respectively, applied to your total bill. 

Customer: That's great! What are the other benefits of each plan? 

Agent: Aside from the discounts mentioned earlier, our monthly plan provides you with the flexibility to make changes to your services at any time without penalty. Our semi-annual and annual plans provide even greater savings as well as a commitment to quality customer service. Additionally, customers who sign up for our semi-annual or annual plans will receive priority technical support and early access to new services and features. 

Customer: That sounds like a great deal. Can I switch between payment plans at any time? 

Agent: Yes, you can switch between payment plans at any time without penalty or additional fees. Please keep in mind that switching from an annual or semi-annual plan to a monthly plan will require an additional setup fee and your discounts will no longer apply. 

Customer: Alright, that makes sense. Do you offer any special promotions or discounts? 

Agent: Yes, we do! We currently have a promotion running where customers who sign up for our annual plan will receive an additional 10% discount off their total bill for the first year of service. 

Customer: That sounds great! I think I'm ready to sign up for Contoso Wireless now. What do I need to do? 

Agent: Great! All you need to do is fill out our online application form and we'll take care of the rest. Once we've received your application we'll contact you within 2 business days with further instructions on how to complete your setup and activate your service.
