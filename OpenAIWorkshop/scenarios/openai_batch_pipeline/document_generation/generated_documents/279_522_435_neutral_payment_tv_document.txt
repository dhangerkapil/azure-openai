Agent: Alright, I've found the details of your order. According to our records, the payment for your Contoso Wireless TV has been processed and it should be delivered within the next three to five business days.

Customer: Alright, thank you for the information. Is there anything else that I need to know before the delivery? 

Agent: Yes, please make sure that someone is available to accept the delivery at the address provided when placing the order. Also, please ensure that there is enough space at the delivery address to accommodate the Contoso Wireless TV as it is quite large and bulky.
