Customer: 
Hi [name], I'm looking to purchase a new phone from Contoso Wireless. Could you tell me more about the product?

Customer Service Agent: 
Of course! We have a wide selection of phones to choose from. Our most popular models are the Contoso GX series and the Contoso Edge. Both are excellent options with great features and specs, but the Edge is our newest model and offers the most up-to-date technology. What kind of phone were you interested in?

Customer: 
I'm looking for something that is reliable and has good battery life. What would you recommend?

Customer Service Agent: 
The Contoso Edge is an excellent choice for reliability and battery life. It has a long-lasting battery that can last up to 24 hours on a single charge, and it has a robust processor that ensures it runs smoothly no matter what you're doing. Plus, it's backed by our industry-leading warranty, so you know it's reliable. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?

Customer: 
That sounds great! Can I also get a discount on my purchase if I sign up for a monthly plan?

Customer Service Agent: 
Absolutely! We offer discounts on all of our phones when you sign up for one of our monthly plans. The amount of the discount will depend on the plan you choose, so please let me know which one you're interested in and I can provide more details.
