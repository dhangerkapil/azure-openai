Hello, this is [Name], a customer service representative from Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today? 

Customer: 
Hi there! I recently got a new phone plan with Contoso Wireless and I'm interested in downgrading my services. Specifically, I was wondering what options I have when it comes to internet? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Thanks for reaching out. We are happy to help you with that. Let me look into what we can do for you. Can you tell me more about your current plan? 

Customer: 
Sure thing! I'm currently on the [Name] plan and it includes unlimited data, calling, and texting. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Got it. Let me check our system to see what options you have for the internet portion of your plan. It looks like we can offer you a few different packages depending on your needs. We have a basic package that offers up to 10GB of data per month, as well as a premium package that offers up to 30GB of data per month. What type of data usage are you expecting? 

Customer: 
I'm not sure yet. I guess it depends on what type of activities I will be doing with my phone. Could you tell me more about the different packages? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Absolutely! The basic package offers up to 10GB of data per month at a rate of $10 per month. This package is ideal for basic web browsing, checking emails, and streaming music. The premium package offers up to 30GB of data per month at a rate of $25 per month. This package is ideal for streaming movies and TV shows, playing online games, and downloading large files. Do either of these packages sound like something that would work for you? 

Customer: 
Yes, the basic package sounds like it would be perfect for me! How do I go about downgrading my services? 

Customer Service Agent: 
No problem! To downgrade your services to the basic internet package, all you need to do is log into your account online and make the changes there. Once you have made the changes, we will apply them to your account and you will start seeing the new charges on your next bill. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: 
No, that should do it for now! Thank you so much for your help - I really appreciate it!
