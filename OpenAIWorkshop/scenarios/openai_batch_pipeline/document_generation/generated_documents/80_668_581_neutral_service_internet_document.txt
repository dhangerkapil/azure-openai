Customer: Yes, that would be great. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, here are some tips that should help improve your connection speed. First, make sure that all of your devices are connected to the same network and that they are not competing for bandwidth with other devices in your home. Additionally, try rebooting your modem or router and check for any software updates for your devices that could be causing an issue with your connection speed. Finally, make sure that you are not running any background applications or processes on your device that could be consuming extra bandwidth or slowing down your connection speed. 

Customer: Alright, those are some good tips. Thank you for the help! 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can do for you today? 

Customer: No, that should do it for now. Thanks again!
