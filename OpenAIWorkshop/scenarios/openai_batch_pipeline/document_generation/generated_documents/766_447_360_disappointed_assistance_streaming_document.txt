Customer: Hi. I'm having an issue with the product streaming service and was wondering if you could help me. 

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! What seems to be the issue? 

Customer: Well, it's been really slow lately and I'm having trouble streaming videos. It's been going on for weeks and nothing seems to help. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Have you tried restarting your device or uninstalling and reinstalling the streaming application? 

Customer: Yes, I have done both of those things but nothing seems to be working. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let me look into this further for you. Can you please provide me with the model of your device? 

Customer: Sure, it's a Contoso Wireless S4. 

Customer Service Agent: Got it. Please bear with me while I investigate this further. In the meantime, can you tell me what kind of videos are you trying to stream? 

Customer: Mostly sports highlights, but sometimes movies as well. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, great. I'm going to take a look at the settings on your device and see if there is something that needs to be adjusted in order to improve your streaming experience. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime? 

Customer: No, that should be all for now. Thanks for your help. 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! I'll be sure to contact you as soon as I have a solution for your streaming issue. Have a great day!
