Customer: 
Hi, I'm having an issue with my phone and I'm looking to upgrade. What are my options?

Agent: 
Hello! Thank you for reaching out to Contoso Wireless. We're here to help you with any of your upgrade needs. Can you tell me more about what is wrong with your current phone?

Customer: 
Well, the battery has been draining quickly and it's been lagging a lot lately. I'm just looking for something that can do more and won't slow me down.

Agent: 
I understand, we have a few options that may fit your needs. We have the Contoso 6S which is our latest model and offers a faster processor and longer battery life than our previous models. We also have the Contoso 7 which has even more features and power than the 6S. Which of these two models are you interested in?

Customer: 
I'm interested in the 7. What are the features of this phone? 

Agent: 
The Contoso 7 offers a 5.7 inch HD display, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, dual rear cameras, and an octa-core processor for quick performance. It also has wireless charging capabilities, an improved battery life compared to our previous models, and access to the latest version of our operating system. It's one of our most popular models and customers love it! Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: 
Yes, what kind of warranty does this phone come with? 

Agent: 
The Contoso 7 comes with a 1-year limited warranty that covers any manufacturer defects or malfunctions that occur within the first year of ownership. In addition, we also offer an extended warranty that covers any additional repairs needed after the first year. Would you like to purchase the extended warranty with your new phone? 

Customer: 
Yes, I think I would like the extended warranty as well. What are my payment options? 

Agent: 
We accept all major credit cards as well as PayPal payments. You can also pay using our financing option which allows you to make payments over time with 0% interest rates. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: 
No, that should be it. Thanks for all your help!
