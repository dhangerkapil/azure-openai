Customer:
Hello, I recently purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and I'm having some trouble setting it up. Can you help me?

Agent:
Hello! We would be more than happy to help you get your new phone set up. What seems to be the problem? 

Customer:
I'm having difficulty connecting the phone to my Wi-Fi network. I've tried multiple times, but nothing seems to be working.

Agent:
No worries, let's take a look at this together. Can you tell me what type of phone you purchased? 

Customer:
Yes, it's the Contoso Wireless X-1000. 

Agent:
Great! First, let's make sure your Wi-Fi network is working properly. Have you tried connecting any other devices to the network? 

Customer: 
Yes, my laptop and tablet are both connected without any issues. 

Agent: 
Ok, that's good news! It sounds like the issue may be with your phone's settings. Can you please tell me what version of software is running on your phone? 

Customer: 
I believe it's running version 4.3. 

Agent: 
Alright, let's go ahead and check the network settings on your phone. First, we need to make sure that the Wi-Fi is enabled. Can you please go into your settings and check if Wi-Fi is turned on? 

Customer: 
Yes, Wi-Fi is enabled. It shows that it is connected to my home network but when I try to open an app or website it doesn't work. 

Agent: 
It sounds like there may be an issue with the DNS settings on your phone. Can you please go into your network settings and check if the DNS is set to Automatic or if it has a specific IP address? 

Customer: 
It's set to Automatic. 

Agent: 
That's great! It looks like that should resolve your issue. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
