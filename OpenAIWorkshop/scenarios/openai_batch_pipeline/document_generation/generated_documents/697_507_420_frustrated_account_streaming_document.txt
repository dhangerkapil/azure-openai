"I'm so frustrated. I recently signed up for your streaming service but I can't seem to get it to work. Can you help me?"

Agent: 
"Of course, I'd be more than happy to help you. Could you please provide me with your account information so I can take a look?"

Customer: 
"Yes, my account number is 909-123-456."

Agent: 
"Thank you. Let me take a look and see what's going on. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue? Are you having trouble logging in or are you having trouble with the streaming service itself?"

Customer: 
"I'm able to log in but when I try to access the streaming service, it just won't load."

Agent: 
"I see. It looks like there might be an issue with your account. Can you please verify that your account is in good standing and that you have paid any outstanding bills or fees?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I've paid everything and my account should be up to date."

Agent: 
"Okay, that's great. It looks like the issue might be related to the streaming service itself then. Have you tried restarting your device or updating the app?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, I've tried both of those things but it still won't work." 

Agent: 
"Alright, let me take a closer look into this issue for you. Could you please provide me with some more information? What type of device are you using and what version of our app are you running?" 

Customer: 
"I'm using an iPhone 8 and I'm running version 3.0 of the app." 

Agent: 
"Got it. Let me see if I can figure out what's going on here. In the meantime, could you please check if there are any software updates available for your device?"
