Customer: I recently bought a phone from Contoso Wireless and I'm having some issues with it.

Agent: Hi there! We apologize for any trouble you may be experiencing with your phone. Could you please explain the issue you are having?

Customer: Sure. It seems like the information is not being saved properly. When I enter something, it just disappears.

Agent: I see. Is this happening when you try to save information to the phone's internal memory or when you try to save something to an external device such as a memory card? 

Customer: Internal memory. 

Agent: Alright, let's take a look at that. Is your phone connected to Wi-Fi? 

Customer: Yes, it is. 

Agent: Great. Please go ahead and open the settings on your phone and select the Storage option. Once you're in there, make sure that you have enough space available for saving information and that your phone is set to save information to its internal memory by default. 

Customer: Okay, I'll do that now. 

Agent: Thank you for doing that. Now, could you please tell me what type of information you're trying to save? Is it contacts, messages, photos, etc.? 

Customer: Photos mostly, but also some documents and notes. 

Agent: Got it. Are these photos stored in the camera roll or in a separate folder? 

Customer: They're in a separate folder. 

Agent: Great! Could you please check if all of the photos are being saved correctly? If they are not, then please try clearing the cache and restarting your phone. That should help resolve the issue. 

Customer: Okay, I'll give that a try. Thank you for your help!
