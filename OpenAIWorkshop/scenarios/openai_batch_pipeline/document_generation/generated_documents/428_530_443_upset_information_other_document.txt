Agent: Absolutely! I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble. Can you tell me a bit more about what's going on?

Customer: Well, I purchased the new product and there doesn't seem to be any instructions or any information about how to set it up. I'm really confused and frustrated.

Agent: I completely understand. Let me see what I can do to help. Can you tell me what model of the product you have?

Customer: Yes, it's the Contoso Wireless Model X3000.

Agent: Okay, great. Let me take a look at the product manual for that model. Can you give me just a few minutes while I look it up?

Customer: Sure, that would be great. Thanks. 

Agent: No problem! I've found the manual for your product and it looks like setting it up should be fairly straightforward. Would you like me to walk you through it? 

Customer: Yes please! That would be great. 

Agent: Alright, let's get started! First, make sure that the device is plugged in and powered on. Then, press the power button located on the top of the device to turn it on. You should see a blue light indicating that the device is powered on. 

Customer: Got it! The blue light is on now. 

Agent: Great! Now, open up your internet browser and navigate to the Contoso Wireless website. Once there, click on the link labeled "Set Up Your Device". This will take you to a page with instructions for setting up your device. Follow these instructions carefully and your device should be up and running in no time! 

Customer: Okay, got it! Thanks so much for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should do it for now. Thanks again!
