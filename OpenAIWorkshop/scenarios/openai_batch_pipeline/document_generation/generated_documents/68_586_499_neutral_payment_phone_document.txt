Customer: I'm looking for something that can handle gaming and streaming media well. Can you tell me more about the Contoso Edge?

Agent: Sure! The Contoso Edge is our flagship device and has the best performance of all our phones. It has a 6-inch screen with full HD resolution and an octa-core processor that can easily handle gaming and streaming media. It also has 128GB of internal storage and 6GB of RAM, so it can store all your files with ease. 

Customer: That sounds great. What about payment options?

Customer: That's really helpful. How does the payment plan work? 

Agent: We offer several different payment plans depending on the phone you choose. For example, if you choose the Contoso Edge, you can opt for a 24-month plan where you pay a fixed amount each month until the full price of the phone is paid off. We also offer 0% interest plans for some devices, so you won't have to worry about any extra costs. 

Customer: That sounds great! Is there any way to get a discount on the phone? 

Agent: Absolutely! We offer several discounts for our customers. You can get a 10% discount if you purchase two phones at once or if you sign up for one of our monthly service plans. We also offer discounts for students, seniors, and military personnel. 

Customer: That's really helpful! Do you have any other deals I should know about? 

Agent: Yes! We offer free shipping on all orders over $50 and we have weekly deals where certain phones are discounted by up to 50%. You can also take advantage of our loyalty program where you get points every time you make a purchase that can be redeemed for discounts or free products in the future.
