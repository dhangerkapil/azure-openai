Contoso Wireless Agent: Hi there! We’d be more than happy to help you out. Could you tell me a bit more about what kind of downgrade services you’re interested in?

Customer: Yes, I was looking at the plans for my current cell phone service and I wanted to know if it was possible to downgrade my plan to a lower tier of service. 

Contoso Wireless Agent: Absolutely. We offer a wide range of plans for our customers, so downgrading your plan is definitely an option. Would you like me to explain the different plans we offer and how they differ? 

Customer: That would be great! I'd love to learn more about the different plans and what they offer. 

Contoso Wireless Agent: No problem. We have three different plans that you can choose from - Basic, Plus, and Premium. Our Basic plan is the most affordable and provides basic calling, texting, and data services. The Plus plan includes more data and additional features like unlimited music streaming. And our Premium plan includes all of the features of the Plus plan plus access to our premium customer support team and a few other features as well. 

Customer: That sounds great! Can you tell me more about the data options for each plan? 

Contoso Wireless Agent: Sure thing! Our Basic plan offers 1GB of data per month, while the Plus plan offers 5GB of data per month. The Premium plan offers 10GB of data per month with the option to add additional data if needed. 

Customer: Wow, that's really helpful! Are there any restrictions on using this data? 

Contoso Wireless Agent: Yes, there are a few restrictions when it comes to using the data included in our plans. First, all data usage is subject to our Fair Usage Policy which means that any excessive use of data may result in additional charges or other penalties. Additionally, certain activities such as streaming music or video may require more data than others and may be subject to extra charges if used beyond the limits of your plan. 

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. Are there any other fees associated with downgrading my service plan? 

Contoso Wireless Agent: Yes, there is a one-time fee of $25 for downgrading your service plan. However, this fee will be waived if you decide to downgrade within 30 days of signing up for your current plan. 

Customer: Alright, that sounds reasonable. Is there anything else I need to know before I decide which plan is right for me? 

Contoso Wireless Agent: Absolutely! Before you make your decision, we recommend that you take a look at our Terms & Conditions page on our website which outlines all of our policies in detail so that you can make an informed decision about which plan is right for you. 

Customer: Great! That sounds really helpful. Thanks so much for taking the time to explain everything to me!
