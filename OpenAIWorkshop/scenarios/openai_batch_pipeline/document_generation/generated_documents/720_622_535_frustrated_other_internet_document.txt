Customer: I've been having a lot of issues with your internet service. I can't seem to get a reliable connection and it's been really frustrating.

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me what kind of issues you've been experiencing?

Customer: Well, for starters, the connection keeps dropping out randomly. I can't even watch videos or play games online without it dropping out. And the speeds are way too slow - sometimes it takes forever just to load a web page!

Customer Service Agent: I see. We want to make sure our customers get the best possible experience with our services, so we'll do whatever we can to help you resolve this issue. Let me check our system and see if there's anything we can do to improve your connection speed and reliability.

Customer: That would be great. It's been really frustrating not being able to rely on the service.

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely. Give me just one moment while I take a look at our system and see what we can do.

[A few moments pass] 

Customer Service Agent: Ok, I've had a look at our system and it looks like your connection is being affected by some external factors that are beyond our control. We're doing our best to try and resolve this issue as quickly as possible, but in the meantime we suggest that you try resetting your router or modem in order to improve your connection speed and reliability. 

Customer: That's not really an ideal solution - why can't Contoso Wireless just fix the problem? 

Customer Service Agent: I understand your frustration, but unfortunately these types of issues are often caused by external factors that are beyond our control. We're doing our best to try and resolve this issue as quickly as possible, but in the meantime resetting your router or modem should help improve your connection speed and reliability while we work on fixing the underlying issue. 

Customer: Alright, I'll give it a try - but if this doesn't work then what? 

Customer Service Agent: If resetting your router or modem doesn't work then we suggest trying other troubleshooting methods such as updating your device drivers or uninstalling any software that may be affecting your connection speed and reliability. If none of these methods work then please don't hesitate to contact us again so that we can further investigate the issue and try to find a solution for you.
