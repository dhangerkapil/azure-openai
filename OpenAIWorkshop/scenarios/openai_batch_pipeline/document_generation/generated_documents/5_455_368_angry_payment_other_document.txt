Customer Service Agent:

Hello, this is [Name], from Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer:

Yes, I need to speak to someone about my payment. It's been a few weeks since I paid for a product and I still haven't received it!

Customer Service Agent:

I apologize for the delay. Could you please provide me with your order number so that I can look into this further? 

Customer: 

Yes, here it is [Order Number]. 

Customer Service Agent: 

Thank you. Please give me one moment while I investigate your order. 

[Pause] 

Alright, I see that your payment was processed and the product should have been shipped out to you three days ago. Is there any other information that you can provide that would help me track the package? 

Customer: 

No, nothing else comes to mind. Can't you just look up the tracking number or something? This is ridiculous! 

Customer Service Agent: 

I apologize for the inconvenience, but unfortunately we don't have access to tracking numbers until after the product has been shipped out. We can however provide you with an estimated time of delivery based on your location and other factors. Would that be helpful? 

 Customer: 

 Yes, that would be helpful. How long until I get it? 

 Customer Service Agent:

 Based on our records, it should take around 5 business days for the product to reach you. If it doesn't arrive by then, please let us know and we will do our best to locate the package and get it to you as soon as possible. Is there anything else that I can help you with today?
