Customer: Hi, I'm having some trouble with the internet connection on my Contoso Wireless plan. I'm constantly having to reset my router and sometimes the connection drops completely.

Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're having issues with your Contoso Wireless plan. Can you tell me a bit more about what's going on?

Customer: Sure. It started a few weeks ago. Every couple of days my router will randomly disconnect from the internet and I have to reset it in order to get it back online. It's getting really annoying because I rely on it for work and it's been disrupting my workflow.

Agent: I understand how frustrating this must be. We'll do our best to get this sorted out for you as quickly as possible. Is there anything else you can tell me about the issue?

Customer: Well, it seems like it's getting worse. Sometimes the connection drops multiple times a day and I have to reset it every time. It's really inconvenient and time consuming.

Agent: That does sound really inconvenient. Let me take a look at your account and see if there is anything we can do to help you out with this issue. Can I get your account number? 

Customer: Sure, it's [ACCOUNT NUMBER]. 

Agent: Alright, let me take a look here... It looks like there may be some underlying issues with your service that could be causing this issue. We're going to need to take a closer look at your account in order to determine what might be causing these issues and how we can fix them. Would you be able to come into one of our stores so that we can take a closer look at your plan and figure out what might be causing this issue? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great. When would be the best time for me to come in? 

Agent: We can certainly accommodate that for you. Our stores are open from 9am-5pm Monday through Friday and 10am-4pm on Saturday and Sunday. Is there a specific day or time that would work best for you? 

Customer: Monday morning at 10am would work best for me. 

Agent: Perfect! We'll make sure that one of our agents is available for you at 10am on Monday morning so that we can take a closer look at your account and figure out what might be causing this issue. In the meantime, if the issue persists, please don't hesitate to give us a call so that we can help troubleshoot any other potential issues in the meantime. 

Customer: Ok, sounds good. Thanks for all your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! We look forward to seeing you on Monday morning at 10am so that we can help get your Contoso Wireless plan up and running again!
