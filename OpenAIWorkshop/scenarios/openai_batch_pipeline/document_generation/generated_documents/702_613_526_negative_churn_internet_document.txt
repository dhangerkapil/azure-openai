Hello, I am having an issue with my Contoso Wireless internet. It has been lagging a lot lately and I'm considering cancelling my subscription. What can you do to help me?

Yes, the internet connection is very slow and it keeps dropping out. I've been having to reset my router multiple times a day. It's very frustrating and it's making it hard for me to work from home.

I appreciate that. Is there any way that you can give me some kind of discount on my bill or something? I'm really not happy with the service I'm getting right now and I'm considering switching providers if this issue isn't resolved soon.
