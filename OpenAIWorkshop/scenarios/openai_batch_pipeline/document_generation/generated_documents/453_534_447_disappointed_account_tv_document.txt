Customer Service Agent: Hi, my name is [Name], and I'm a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, [Name]. I'm having some issues with my account. It seems like I'm being charged for a TV I never purchased.

Customer Service Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what product it is that you're being charged for?

Customer: It's a TV. But I never purchased it. So why am I being charged?

Customer Service Agent: Let me take a look at your account and see if I can figure out what happened. Can you provide me with the last four digits of your account number?

Customer: Sure, it's 4587.

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for providing me with that information. It looks like the TV was added to your account on October 12th, 2020. Is that correct? 

Customer: No, that's not correct. I never purchased a TV. 

Customer Service Agent: I understand your concern and apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. We will investigate this issue further and take the necessary steps to resolve it as soon as possible. Can you please provide me with some more information regarding the purchase? 

Customer: Sure, what kind of information do you need? 

Customer Service Agent: We need to know the type of TV that was added to your account, when it was added, and if there were any additional accessories included with the purchase. 

Customer: Okay, so it was a 55 inch LED Smart TV and it was added to my account on October 12th. And no there weren't any additional accessories included with the purchase. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, thank you for providing us with that information. We will look into this matter further and contact you as soon as we have an update regarding the issue. In the meantime, we would advise you to change your account password just in case there has been any unauthorized access to your account information.
