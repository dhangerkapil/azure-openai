Hello, I'm having a problem with my Contoso Wireless TV. I'm not getting a good signal. 

Agent:
Hello, I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue you are having with your Contoso Wireless TV?

Customer:
Yes, the picture quality is really poor. I can barely make out what's on the screen. It's really frustrating.

Agent:
I understand how frustrating this can be. Have you tried to reset the TV or change the settings to see if that would improve the picture quality?

Customer:
Yes, I have done all of that and it didn't help. I'm really disappointed in the product. 

Agent:

It's the model XJ-12345.
