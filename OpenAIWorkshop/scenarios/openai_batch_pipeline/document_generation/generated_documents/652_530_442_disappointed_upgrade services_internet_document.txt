Customer Service Agent: Hi, welcome to Contoso Wireless. How may I help you? 

Customer: Hi, I'm really disappointed with the upgrade services you offer. I'm looking to upgrade my internet, but your service just isn't good enough. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for your dissatisfaction. Can you tell me more about what you're looking for? 

Customer: Well, I need a reliable internet connection that won't slow down or drop out at random times. It also needs to be fast enough to stream video and play online games without lagging. 

Customer Service Agent: We understand your need for a reliable and fast internet connection. We offer a variety of plans to meet your needs. What speed do you need? 

Customer: I need something at least 25 Mbps download speed and 5 Mbps upload speed. 

Customer Service Agent: We can certainly provide that. We offer a plan with those speeds for $50 per month. Would you like to sign up? 

Customer: No, that's too expensive for me. Is there any way you can lower the price? 

Customer Service Agent: Unfortunately, the price is set and cannot be lowered at this time. However, we do offer a discounted rate if you sign up for an annual plan instead of a monthly plan. The annual plan is only $45 per month and will save you money in the long run. 

Customer: That's still too much money for me. Do you have any other plans that are cheaper? 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, we do have another plan that offers lower speeds but it is more affordable. This plan offers 10 Mbps download speed and 2 Mbps upload speed for only $30 per month. Would this be a better option for you? 

Customer: Yes, that would be much better. I think I'll go with that plan then. 

Customer Service Agent: Great! Let me get everything set up for you right away and we'll have your new internet connection up and running in no time. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
