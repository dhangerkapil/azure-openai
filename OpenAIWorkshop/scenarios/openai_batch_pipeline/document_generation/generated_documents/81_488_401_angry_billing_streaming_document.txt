Customer: "I just got my latest bill from Contoso Wireless and I'm furious. I was supposed to get unlimited streaming with my plan, but it looks like I was charged extra for streaming."

Agent: "I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please provide me with your account number so I can look into this further?"

Customer: "My account number is XXXXXX. I expect an explanation for why I was charged extra for something that should have been included in my plan."

Agent: "Thank you for providing the account number. I'm looking into your account now and it appears that you were not charged extra for streaming. You were charged for a separate product called Premium Streaming, which is not included in your plan."

Customer: "What? That doesn't make any sense. How did this happen?"

Agent: "I understand your frustration. It appears that when you signed up for your plan, you selected the Premium Streaming option, which is an additional charge. This is why you were charged extra."

Customer: "But I never selected that option! This must be some kind of mistake."

Agent: "I apologize again for the confusion. Let me check if there is a way to refund you the charge and remove the Premium Streaming option from your plan."

Customer: "Yes, please do that as soon as possible. This isn't fair."

Agent: "I completely understand. I've gone ahead and processed a refund for the charge and removed the Premium Streaming option from your plan. You should see this reflected on your next bill."

Customer: "Thank you. Can you tell me how this happened in the first place? I don't want this to happen again."

Agent: "Of course. It appears that when you signed up for your plan, there was a misunderstanding about what was included in the plan. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused."
