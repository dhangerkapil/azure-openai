Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a TV from your company Contoso Wireless and I am having some trouble setting it up. Could you please provide some assistance?

Agent: Hi there, I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me see what I can do to help. What exactly seems to be the problem?

Customer: Well, I can't seem to get the TV to turn on. I'm sure it's something simple that I'm overlooking, but it's just not working.

Agent: Alright, let's start from the basics. Have you checked to make sure that the power cord is securely connected to the outlet and to the back of the TV?

Customer: Yes, that was the first thing I checked. The cord is connected properly and the outlet is working too because I have other devices plugged into it that are working.

Agent: Okay, then we'll need to take a look at the settings on your TV. Are you able to access your TV menu? 

Customer: Yes, I can access the menu. But when I go into it, nothing happens when I try to turn on the TV. 

Agent: Alright, let's take a look at the settings and make sure everything is in order. Can you tell me what model of TV you have? 

Customer: Yes, it's a Contoso Wireless 55-inch Smart TV model XB5006. 

Agent: Got it. Let me take a look at our records and see if there's anything specific we need to do with this model. In the meantime, can you check if there is any kind of power switch on your TV? It might be located on the side or back of your TV depending on its model type. 

Customer: Ok, let me check....Yes! There is a power switch located on the back of my TV. It was switched off by mistake. Thank you so much for helping me figure this out! 

Agent: No problem! Glad we were able to get it sorted out for you. Is there anything else we can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should do it for now. Thank you again for your help!
