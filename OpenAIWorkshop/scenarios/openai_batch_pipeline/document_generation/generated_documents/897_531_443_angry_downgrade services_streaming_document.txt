Agent: Hi, I apologize for the inconvenience you are experiencing with the streaming product. I am here to help get this sorted out. Can you please provide me with more information about the issue?

Customer: Yes, my account number is 1234567890 and my phone number is (123) 456-7890.

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. Please give me a few moments while I investigate the issue and see what can be done to resolve it. 

Customer: Okay, I'm waiting.

Customer: No, that's all. 

Agent: Thank you for speaking with us today. We hope that we were able to resolve this issue and provide some clarity on the services included in your package when you downgraded your service. Is there anything else we can do for you?
