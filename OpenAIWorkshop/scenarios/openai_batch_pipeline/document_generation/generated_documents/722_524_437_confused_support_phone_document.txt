Customer: Hello, I'm looking for help with my Contoso Wireless phone.

Customer Service Agent: Hi there! How can I help you with your Contoso Wireless phone?

Customer: Well, I'm having some trouble connecting to the internet. It keeps saying that my connection is unstable.

Customer Service Agent: Let's see what we can do about that. Could you tell me a bit more about the issue? Are you connected to a Wi-Fi network or using cellular data?

Customer: I'm connected to Wi-Fi, but it's still not working.

Customer Service Agent: Okay, let's start by checking the connection settings on your phone. Could you go to the settings menu and tell me what type of connection you have selected?

Customer: It says I'm connected to a wireless network, but it's still not working.

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let's try a few other things. Can you go into the Wi-Fi settings and check if your router is listed there? If it is, try connecting to it manually instead of automatically. 

Customer: Okay, I can do that. What else should I try? 

Customer Service Agent: If that doesn't work, we can also try resetting your phone's network settings. This will erase any saved networks and passwords so you will need to re-enter them when setting up the Wi-Fi again. 

Customer: Alright, I'll give it a shot. Is there anything else I should try? 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, if all else fails we can try performing a factory reset on your phone. This will restore all settings back to their default state and may resolve any connection issues you are having. However, this will also erase all data from your phone so make sure you have backed up any important information before doing this. 

Customer: Okay, I'll give it a try and see if that helps. Thank you for your help! 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
