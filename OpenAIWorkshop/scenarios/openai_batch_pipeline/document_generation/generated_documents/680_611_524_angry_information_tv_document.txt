Customer Service Agent:

Hello, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer:
I'm calling because I recently purchased a television from your company and I'm having some issues with it. I need to know what kind of information I need to provide in order to get it fixed.

Customer Service Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience. In order to help you out, I'll need some information about the television you purchased. Could you please provide me with the model number of the television?

Customer:
Yes, the model number is 123456. What other information do you need?

Customer Service Agent:
Thanks for providing the model number. In order to help you further, I will need to know what kind of issues you are having with your television. Can you tell me more about the problem? 

Customer:
The TV keeps turning itself off and on randomly. It's really frustrating and I don't know what to do. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I apologize for the trouble that you're having with your TV. Could you please let me know if there have been any recent changes made to your home network or router settings? 

Customer: 
No, nothing has changed since I got it set up a few weeks ago. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Alright, thanks for letting me know that nothing has changed. In order to get this issue fixed, we will need to take a look at your router settings and see if there are any changes that need to be made in order for your TV to work properly. Do you have access to your router settings? 

Customer: 
Yes, I do have access to my router settings. What do I need to do? 

Customer Service Agent: 
We will need to run a diagnostic test on your router in order to determine what changes may be necessary for your TV to work properly. We can either do this remotely or if you prefer we can send someone out to take a look at it in person. What would you prefer? 

Customer: 
I would prefer if someone came out in person so they can take a closer look at the issue. Can you send someone out soon? 

 Customer Service Agent: 
Of course! We can have someone come out as soon as possible. All we need is for you to confirm your address so that we can send out a technician right away. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
