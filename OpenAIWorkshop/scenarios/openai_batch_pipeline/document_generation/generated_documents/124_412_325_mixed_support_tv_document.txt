Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a new Contoso Wireless TV and I'm having some issues with it.

Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

Customer: Well, the picture quality is really poor and it's not responding to the remote control. 

Agent: Alright, let's take a look at this. Is your TV connected to the internet?

Customer: Yes, it is connected. 

Agent: Great. Can you please check if your TV is up to date with the latest software version? 

Customer: Yes, I just checked and it is running the latest version. 

Agent: That's good to know. Can you tell me what kind of remote control you're using? 

Customer: It's a Contoso Wireless remote control that came with the TV. 

Agent: Okay, can you try replacing the batteries in your remote control? That should solve the issue with the remote not responding. 

Customer: Sure, I'll give that a try. What about the picture quality? Is there anything else I can do? 

Agent: Yes, there are a few things you can try. First, make sure that your TV is connected to an HDTV antenna or cable box. You should also check your TV settings and make sure that the picture mode and picture settings are set correctly for your TV type and viewing environment. You can also try resetting your TV and see if that improves the picture quality.
