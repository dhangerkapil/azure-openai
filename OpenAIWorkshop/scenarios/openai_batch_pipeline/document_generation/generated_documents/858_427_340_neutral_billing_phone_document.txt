Customer: Hi, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm looking for help with my billing.

Agent: Hi there! How can I help you today?

Customer: I recently purchased a new phone from Contoso Wireless and I'm not sure how it's going to affect my bill. Can you tell me more about it?

Agent: Absolutely! We're glad to hear you're enjoying your new phone. When you purchased the phone, you should have been given an estimated monthly bill amount, based on your plan. This amount is an estimate of what your bill will be, but it may vary slightly due to taxes, fees, and other factors. 

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. So what happens if I exceed the estimated bill amount? 

Agent: If you exceed the estimated bill amount, you may be subject to additional charges. We recommend staying within your estimated bill amount in order to avoid any extra charges. 

Customer: Alright, I understand. Is there anything else I should know about my new phone and billing? 

Agent: Yes, we suggest you keep an eye on your usage each month in order to stay within the estimated bill amount. You can check your usage online or through our app anytime to see how much data or minutes you have used for the month. Additionally, if you need any help understanding your usage or have any questions about your plan or billing, please don't hesitate to contact us! 

Customer: That's great! Thanks for all the information. 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
