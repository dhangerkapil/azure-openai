Good morning, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. How may I help you today? 

Customer: 

Hi there. I'm not happy with the service I've been receiving from your company. I recently purchased a product from you, and it's not working properly. I'm hoping you can help me with this issue. 

Customer Service Agent:

I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please provide me with some more details so that I can help you better? 

Customer: 

Sure. I purchased a phone from your store about two weeks ago, and it's been having all sorts of problems since then. It won't turn on, and when it does, it freezes up after a few minutes. I tried to take it back to the store, but they said they couldn't do anything about it since it was past the return date. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I understand your frustration. Let me see what we can do about this issue. Can you please tell me the model number of the phone you purchased? 

Customer: 

Yes, it's model number XZ3223. 

Customer Service Agent: 

Thank you for providing that information. Please allow me a few moments while I look into this further. 

 (A few moments pass)

 Customer Service Agent: 

 After looking into your issue, I'm sorry to say that we cannot do anything about this issue as the return period has already passed. However, we can offer you a discounted price on another product as a way of apologizing for any inconvenience caused by this issue. Would you like to take advantage of this offer? 

 Customer: 

 That would be great, thank you! What kind of products do you have available? 

 Customer Service Agent: 

 We currently have a wide range of products available, including phones, tablets, laptops, and accessories. Do any of these interest you?
