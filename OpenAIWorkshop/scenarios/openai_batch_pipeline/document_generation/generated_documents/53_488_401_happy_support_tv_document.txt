Customer: Hello! I'm having some trouble with my Contoso Wireless TV. I need some help.

Agent: Hi there! I'm glad you reached out for help. How can I help you today?

Customer: Well, I've been having some issues with the picture quality on my Contoso Wireless TV. It's been blurry and pixelated for a few days now and I'm not sure what to do. 

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's see what we can do to get that picture quality back up to par. Could you please tell me what model of Contoso Wireless TV you have?

Customer: Yes, it's a 55" HD Smart TV. 

Agent: Alright, let me look into this for you. Could you please tell me what type of connections you are using to connect the TV to your device? 

Customer: Yes, I'm using an HDMI cable connection and I have also tried connecting it through Wi-Fi but it doesn't seem to be working properly. 

Agent: Alright, let me take a look at the connection settings on your TV. Could you please turn off the TV and then unplug it from the wall for 30 seconds before plugging it back in? 

Customer: Sure thing! I'll do that now and let you know when it's done. 

Agent: Great! Once you've done that, could you please turn the TV back on and let me know if the picture quality has improved? 

Customer: Sure thing! Just a few seconds... Okay, it's on now. The picture quality looks much better now, thank you! 

Agent: Great! I'm glad we were able to get that sorted out for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should be all. Thank you so much for your help!
