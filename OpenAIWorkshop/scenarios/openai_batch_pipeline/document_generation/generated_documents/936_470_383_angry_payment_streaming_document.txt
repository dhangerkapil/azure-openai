"I'm really angry about my payment for the Contoso Wireless streaming service! I was charged twice, and I'm not sure why. I want to know what's going on!"

Agent: 
"Hello there, I'm sorry to hear you're unhappy with your payment for our streaming service. Can you tell me a bit more about the situation?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I recently signed up for the Contoso Wireless streaming service, and I was charged twice for the same subscription. It's not right!"

Agent: 
"I understand how that could be concerning. Can you tell me what day you signed up for the service and what method of payment you used?"

Customer: 
"I signed up on August 21st and used my Visa card to pay for the subscription. Why was I charged twice?"

Agent: 
"Let me take a look at that for you. Can you provide me with your account number or the email address associated with your account?"

Customer: 
"Yes, my account number is 123456789 and my email address is customer@example.com."

Agent: 
"Thanks for providing that information. I can see that we did charge your Visa card twice for the same subscription on August 21st. It looks like one of our systems had a glitch and it caused a duplicate charge to be processed."

Customer: 
"That's unacceptable! I want to know how this happened and when I'll get my money back!"

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. We're working hard to make sure something like this doesn't happen again in the future. As far as getting your money back, we can process a refund to your Visa card within 5-7 business days."
