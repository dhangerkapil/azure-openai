"I am so disappointed with the phone I bought from Contoso Wireless. The service is terrible and I want to downgrade my plan. What are my options?"

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced. We would be more than happy to help you downgrade your service plan. Can you tell me what type of phone you have and what services you currently have?"

Customer: 
"I have the iPhone XS Max and my current plan includes unlimited talk, text, and data. I just don't need all that anymore."

Agent: 
"Ok, I understand. We have several different plans that may be a better fit for your needs. Our basic plan includes 500 minutes of talk, 1000 texts, and 1GB of data for only $19.99 per month. Would this be something you are interested in?"

Customer: 
"That sounds like a much better deal, but I'm worried that it won't give me enough data. Is there a plan with more data available?"

Agent: 
"Yes, absolutely! We offer a 4GB data plan for $34.99 per month. This plan includes 1000 minutes of talk, unlimited text, and 4GB of data. Is this something that interests you?"

Customer: 
"Yes, that's perfect! I would like to switch to the 4GB data plan."

Agent: 
"Great! I'm glad we were able to find a plan that fits your needs better. I can go ahead and make the switch right now if you'd like." 

Customer: 
"Yes, please go ahead and make the switch. Thank you for your help!" 

Agent: 
"You're welcome! The switch will take effect immediately and your new plan will be reflected in your next billing cycle. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
