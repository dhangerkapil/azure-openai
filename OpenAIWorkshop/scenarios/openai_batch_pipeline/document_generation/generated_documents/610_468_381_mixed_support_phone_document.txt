Thank you for your patience. It appears that this model of phone has been identified as having a hardware issue that affects its ability to connect to the internet and make calls. We recommend sending it in for repairs at our service center. Alternatively, we can provide you with a replacement phone if you would prefer that option instead.

I think sending it in for repairs would be the best option, since I don't want to go through the hassle of setting up a new phone.

That's understandable. We'll be happy to send you a prepaid shipping label so that you can easily send in your device for repairs. Once we receive your device, we'll assess it and let you know the results of our assessment and any additional steps that need to be taken to repair it.
