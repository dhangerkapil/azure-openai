Agent: Hello! Thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. How may I help you today? 

Customer: I'm having some trouble understanding my bill. Could you explain it to me? 

Agent: Absolutely! Can you tell me a bit more about the issue? 

Customer: Well, I just got my bill and it looks like I'm being charged for a phone that I don't have. 

Agent: Okay, let's take a look at that. Can you provide me with your account number and billing information so that I can access your account? 

Customer: Sure, here it is. 

Agent: Thanks. Let me take a look here. It looks like you were charged for a new phone that you recently purchased from Contoso Wireless. Is this correct? 

Customer: Yes, that's right. But I returned the phone two weeks ago and haven't received a refund yet. 

Agent: Alright, let me check on that for you. It looks like the refund has been processed and should show up on your next statement. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: Yes, actually. I'm considering getting a different phone from Contoso Wireless but I want to make sure that I understand all of the fees and charges associated with it before I make my decision. Can you tell me more about the fees associated with this phone? 

Agent: Absolutely! Let me pull up the details for you now. It looks like the phone comes with an activation fee of $50 and a monthly service fee of $45 plus taxes and fees. Are there any other questions I can answer for you? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help!
