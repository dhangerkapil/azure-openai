Hello, my name is John and I am a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today? 

Customer:

Yes, hello. I'm having a problem with your product. It's not working properly and I need some assistance. 

Customer Service Agent:

I apologize for the inconvenience you are experiencing. Can you tell me what type of product it is and what kind of problem you are having? 

Customer: 

I recently purchased the Contoso Wireless Smartphone from your store, and it isn't working properly. The screen won't turn on, and when I try to make a call, nothing happens. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I see. Are you still under warranty? If so, we can have one of our technicians look at it and repair it for you. 

Customer: 

Yes, I am still under warranty. That would be great if you could do that. How long would it take? 

Customer Service Agent: 

Typically repairs take between 3-5 business days, but depending on the severity of the issue, it could take longer or shorter. We will do our best to get it back to you as soon as possible. 

 Customer: 

 Okay, that sounds good. Is there anything else I need to do before sending it in for repair? 

 Customer Service Agent: 

 Yes, please make sure to back up all your data before sending in your device for repair. Once you have done that, please package your device securely and send it to our repair center with a note detailing the issue that you are experiencing. We will take care of the rest from there!
