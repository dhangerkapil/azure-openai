Agent: Hi, how can I help you with your account?

Customer: Well, I recently bought a phone from your company, Contoso Wireless, and I'm having trouble setting it up. 

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. What kind of phone did you purchase? 

Customer: It's the Contoso Vibe. I followed all the instructions, but it's not working. 

Agent: Have you tried restarting the device? 

Customer: Yes, I've restarted it several times but nothing seems to be working. 

Agent: Can you please provide me with your account information so that I can look into this further? 

Customer: Sure, here's my account number and password. 

Agent: Thanks for providing the information. Let me take a look and see what's going on here. Please give me a few minutes while I investigate this issue. 

Customer: Alright, but please make it quick. I'm getting really frustrated with this phone and I need it to work as soon as possible. 

Agent: Absolutely, I understand your frustration and will do my best to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. In the meantime, can you tell me what exactly is happening when you try to set up the phone? 

Customer: When I turn it on, it just shows a blank screen and won't do anything else. It won't even connect to the internet or let me log in. 

Agent: Hmm... that doesn't sound right. Let me check if there are any updates available for the phone that you might have missed. Can you please wait while I investigate this further? 

Customer: Sure, but hurry up! 

Agent: No problem, I'll get back to you as soon as possible with an update on what's going on with your phone.
