Hello, I'm having an issue with my internet connection. It's been slow and lagging for the past couple of days and I'm not sure why. Can you help me figure out what's going on?

Agent: 

Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that you're having issues with your internet connection. Can you tell me a bit more about the problem? Are you experiencing any other issues, such as difficulty connecting to certain websites or applications?

Customer:

Yes, I am having trouble connecting to certain websites. Also, my download speeds are much slower than usual and my uploads are taking forever. 

Agent: 

I understand. We have some troubleshooting steps we can try to help resolve the issue. Could you please let me know what type of device you're using to connect to the internet? 

Customer: 

I'm using a laptop with Windows 10. 

Agent: 
Okay, let's start by running a few tests on your device. Can you please open the Command Prompt and run an "ipconfig /all" command? This will give us some information about your network connection that can help us troubleshoot the issue. 

Customer: 
I've done that and the results look normal to me. What else can I do? 

Agent: 
Let's try a few other things. Can you please try running a speed test on your device and let me know what speeds you're getting? You can use an online tool like Speedtest.net or Fast.com to check your internet speeds. 

Customer: 
I've run a speed test and it looks like my download speeds are much lower than what they should be, but my upload speeds are normal. What could be causing this issue? 

 Agent:  
It could be caused by a variety of things, such as a faulty router or modem, interference from other devices in the area, or even an issue with your ISP's network. Let's try resetting your router first and see if that helps improve your speeds. Can you please try that for me?
