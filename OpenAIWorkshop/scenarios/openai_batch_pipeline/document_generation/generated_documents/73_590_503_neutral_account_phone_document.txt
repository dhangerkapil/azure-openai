Customer: 

That sounds great! What kind of plans do you offer with the phone?

We have several plans available to fit your needs. Our basic plan includes unlimited talk and text with 2GB of data per month. We also offer an unlimited data plan with no data cap and access to 5G speeds when available. Additionally, we have a family plan that allows up to four people to share one plan and save on their monthly bill.

Do you offer any additional features with the plans?

Yes! All of our plans include access to our Contoso Rewards program, which gives you discounts on select items from participating retailers. We also have a free 24/7 customer service line where you can get help with any questions or issues you may have with your phone or account. Finally, we offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee so that if you're not happy with your purchase, you can return it for a full refund. 

Customer: 
Are there any additional fees I should be aware of?

There are no additional fees associated with our plans. The only extra cost is if you decide to add extra data or upgrade to a higher tier plan. We also offer device protection plans that cover accidental damage and theft so you don't have to worry about costly repairs or replacements if something happens to your phone.
