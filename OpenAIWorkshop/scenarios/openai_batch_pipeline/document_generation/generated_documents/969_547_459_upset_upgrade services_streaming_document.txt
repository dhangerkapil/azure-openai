Customer: 
I was expecting to receive video streaming services as part of my upgrade package.

I see. It looks like the product streaming service you were expecting is not included in the upgrade package you purchased. We do offer a separate product streaming package that includes video streaming services. Would you like me to provide you with more information about this package?

Yes, please provide me with more information about the product streaming package. How much does it cost and what type of services does it include?

The product streaming package costs $19.99 per month and includes access to a variety of video streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. Would you like me to add this package to your account so that you can start using it right away? 

Customer: 
Yes, please add the product streaming package to my account so that I can start using it right away. Thank you for your help!
