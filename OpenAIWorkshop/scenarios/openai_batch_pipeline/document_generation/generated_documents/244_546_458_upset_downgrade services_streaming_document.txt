Hello, this is Contoso Wireless customer service. How may I help you today?

Customer: 
I recently downgraded my services with Contoso Wireless and I am having problems with the product streaming. Can you please explain what is going on?

Customer Service Agent: 
Certainly, I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. Could you provide me with more information about the issue you are experiencing?

Customer: 
Well, when I try to stream a product, it does not load and says "error". What do I need to do to get this resolved?

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand your frustration. Let me look into this for you. Can you please provide me with some additional information such as the type of device you are using, the version of the operating system, and the version of the streaming application?

Customer: 
I am using an Android phone with version 8.0 of the operating system and version 4.3 of the streaming application. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Thank you for that information. I will now look into this for you and see what we can do to resolve this issue. In the meantime, could you please tell me if you have tried any troubleshooting steps such as clearing your cache or restarting your device?

Customer: 
Yes, I have tried both of those steps but they did not work. Is there anything else that I can do? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, we can try a few more things to try and get this resolved. First, could you please check if there is an update available for your streaming application? If so, please update it and then try streaming again. Additionally, could you please check if your device has enough storage space available? If not, try freeing up some space by deleting unnecessary apps or files and then try streaming again. Lastly, could you please check if your Wi-Fi connection is strong enough? If not, try switching to a different network and then try streaming again. 

Customer: 
Ok, I will try all of those steps and see if it resolves my issue. Thank you for all your help!
