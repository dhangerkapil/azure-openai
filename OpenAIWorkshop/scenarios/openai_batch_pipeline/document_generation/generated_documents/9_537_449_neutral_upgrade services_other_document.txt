With our basic package, you get 2GB of data per month while with our premium package you get unlimited data. Additionally, our premium package includes additional features such as call waiting, caller ID, voicemail, international calling and more. 

Customer: Interesting. What about pricing?

Customer: Are there any other advantages to upgrading my service? 

Agent: Absolutely! With our premium plan, you'll get access to exclusive content and offers that are not available with our basic plan. You'll also get access to our customer support team who are available 24/7 to help with any questions or concerns you may have. Lastly, you'll be eligible for discounts on select products and services. 

Customer: That all sounds great! Can I try out the premium package before committing to it? 

Agent: Absolutely! We offer a free trial period for our premium package so that you can try it out before committing to it. The trial period is 14 days and during that time you can use all of the features included in the premium package without being charged for them. Once the trial period ends, you can choose to keep the premium package or switch back to the basic one if you don't like it.
