Customer: Hello, I recently bought a TV from Contoso Wireless and it's not working properly. I'm very unhappy with it and need help. 

Agent: Hi there, I apologize for the inconvenience you're having. Can you tell me more about the issue you're having?

Customer: Yes, the sound isn't working properly. There's a crackling noise coming from the speakers. 

Agent: I understand how frustrating this must be. Is there anything else you can tell me about the issue? 

Customer: Yes, when I try to adjust the volume, nothing happens. It just stays at one level and doesn't change. 

Agent: Alright, thank you for letting me know. Can you tell me what model of TV you purchased? 

Customer: It's a Contoso Wireless 50 inch 4K UHD Smart TV. 

Agent: Okay, thank you for that information. I'll look into this right away and see what I can do to help. Please give me a few minutes while I investigate this further. 

Customer: Okay, thank you. 

[Several minutes pass] 

Agent: Alright, I've been looking into this issue and it looks like there may be an issue with the TV's hardware itself. Would it be possible for us to send out a technician to take a look at it? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great! When do you think they would be able to come by? 

Agent: Our technicians are available Monday through Friday from 9AM to 5PM. Would any of those times work for you? 

Customer: Yes, that would work for me. Please send out a technician as soon as possible so I can get this issue resolved quickly. 

Agent: Absolutely! We'll send out a technician as soon as we can and they'll be able to diagnose and fix the issue for you in no time. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: No, that should be all for now. Thank you very much for your help!
