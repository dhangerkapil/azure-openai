Hello, my name is [Name], and I'm a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How may I help you today?

Customer:
I recently purchased a phone from your company, and it's been nothing but trouble since I got it. I can't get it to work properly and I'm very frustrated. 

Customer Service Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you tell me what exactly seems to be the problem with your phone? 

Customer:
Well, for starters, the battery life is terrible. It dies within an hour of use and needs to be recharged almost constantly. Plus, the phone keeps randomly restarting itself and sometimes won't turn on at all. 

Customer Service Agent:
I understand how frustrating that must be. Could you please tell me which model phone you have purchased? 

Customer:
Yes, it's a Contoso Smartphone XS Max. 

Customer Service Agent:

Customer: 
Yes, the touch screen isn't working properly either. It's not responding to my commands and sometimes won't even register my touches at all. 

Customer Service Agent:
I apologize for the issue you are having with your phone's touch screen. We will do our best to get this resolved for you as quickly as possible. Can you please provide me with your contact information so that we can look into this further? 

Customer: 
Sure, my name is [Name] and my email address is [email]. My phone number is [Phone Number]. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Thank you for providing me with your contact information. We'll look into this issue right away and will get back to you shortly with an update on the status of your phone repair or replacement. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

 Customer: No, that should be all for now. Thank you for your help!
