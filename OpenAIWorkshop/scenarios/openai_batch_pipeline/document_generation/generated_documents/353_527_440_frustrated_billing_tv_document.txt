Customer: "I just got my bill for the month and it looks like I'm being charged for a product I never even ordered. It's called Contoso Wireless TV and it says I'm being charged $50 for the month. I don't even have a TV, so why am I being charged for this?"

Agent: "I apologize for any confusion. Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on here. Can you provide me with your account number or email address?"

Customer: "Sure, it's 12345@gmail.com"

Agent: "Thanks, I've pulled up your account information. It looks like you recently signed up for Contoso Wireless TV. It's a streaming service that gives you access to thousands of movies and shows, plus live sports and news."

Customer: "But I never signed up for this! Why am I being charged for something I never asked for?"

Agent: "It looks like you may have accidentally clicked on an advertisement or link on our website that offered a free trial of Contoso Wireless TV. Unfortunately, if you don't cancel within the trial period, you will be automatically charged for the service."

Customer: "So what do I do now? Can I get a refund?"

Agent: "I apologize but we cannot offer refunds once the trial period has expired. However, we can cancel your subscription and you will not be charged any further fees." 

Customer: "OK, so how do I cancel my subscription?" 

Agent: "It's easy! All you need to do is log into your account and go to the 'Subscriptions' tab. There you'll find an option to cancel your subscription. Once cancelled, you will no longer be charged for Contoso Wireless TV." 

Customer: "OK great, thanks for your help!" 

Agent: "You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?" 

Customer: "No that should be it. Thanks again!" 

Agent: "No problem! Have a great day!"
