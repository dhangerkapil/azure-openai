Hello, this is the customer service department for Contoso Wireless. How may I help you today?

Customer:

I'm trying to figure out your product streaming services, but I'm really confused. Can you help me out?

Customer Service Agent: 

Yes, absolutely! We'd be happy to explain the product streaming services. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically you are having trouble understanding? 

Customer: 

Well, I don't understand how the streaming works. Do I have to pay a subscription fee or can I access it for free? 

Customer Service Agent: 

That depends on the type of streaming service you choose. We offer both free and paid streaming options. The free option allows you to access limited content while the paid option gives you access to our full library of content. 

Customer: 

Okay, so if I pay for the full streaming service, do I get access to all the content that Contoso Wireless offers? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, that's correct. You'll have access to all the content that Contoso Wireless has available for streaming. This includes movies, TV shows, music, and more. 

Customer: 
That sounds great! But what about customer support? Is there someone I can contact if I have any questions or issues with my streaming service?

Absolutely! Our customer service team is always available to help with any questions or concerns related to our streaming services. You can reach us by phone or email and we'll be happy to assist you.
