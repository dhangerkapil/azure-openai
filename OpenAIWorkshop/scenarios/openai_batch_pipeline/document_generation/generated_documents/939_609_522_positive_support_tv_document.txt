Hello, I'm looking for some help regarding the Contoso Wireless TV. I was wondering if you could help me out?

Agent:
Hello there! We are happy to help. What kind of support do you need regarding the Contoso Wireless TV?

Customer:
I'm having trouble connecting it to my Wi-Fi network. Is there any way you can help me out with that?

Agent:
Yes, absolutely! We are more than happy to help you with this issue. First, let's make sure your Wi-Fi network is compatible with the Contoso Wireless TV. Can you tell me what type of Wi-Fi network you have? 

Customer: 
I have a dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz network. 

Agent: 
Great! That should be compatible with our TV. Can you please confirm that the Wi-Fi is enabled on your Contoso Wireless TV? 

Customer: 
Yes, the Wi-Fi is enabled on my Contoso Wireless TV. 

Agent: 
Ok, great. Now we just need to make sure that the TV is connected to the right network. Can you please check the network name on your TV and confirm it matches your router's network name? 

Customer: 
Yes, they match. The names are identical. 

Agent: 
Fantastic! It looks like everything is in order for us to connect your Contoso Wireless TV to your Wi-Fi network. Let's go ahead and try connecting it now. Please go to the Network Settings menu on your TV and select “Connect to Wi-Fi” from the list of options. 

Customer: 
Ok, I'm in the Network Settings menu now and I see the “Connect to Wi-Fi” option. What do I do next? 

 Agent: 
The next step is to select your home Wi-Fi network from the list of available networks that appears on the screen after you select “Connect to Wi-Fi”. Once you've selected your home Wi-Fi network, enter the password for it and press "OK" or "Connect" on your remote control or TV screen. This should establish a connection between your Contoso Wireless TV and your home Wi-Fi network. Does this make sense?  

 Customer: 
Yes, that makes sense! I'll give it a try now and let you know if it works!
