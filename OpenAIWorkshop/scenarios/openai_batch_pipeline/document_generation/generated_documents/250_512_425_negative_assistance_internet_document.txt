Customer:

Hello, I'm having a lot of trouble with my Contoso Wireless internet connection. Can you help me out?

Agent:

Good afternoon, my name is [Agent Name], and I'm here to help you with your Contoso Wireless internet connection. Can you please tell me what seems to be the issue?

Customer:

Yes, my internet keeps going in and out and it's been happening for the past few days. It's really frustrating. 

Agent: 
I'm sorry to hear that. Is this happening on all of your devices or just one specific device? 

Customer: 
It's happening on all of my devices. 

Agent: 
Okay, let's take a look at what could be causing this issue. Could you please provide me with some more information about the devices you're using? 

Customer: 
Sure, I'm using a laptop, two smartphones, and an iPad. All are connected to the Contoso Wireless network. 

Agent: 
Alright, let's start by troubleshooting your laptop. Is the issue only happening when you're using your laptop or is it also happening on your other devices? 

Customer: 
It's happening on all of them. 

Agent: 
Okay, so it appears that there may be an issue with the Contoso Wireless network itself. To better understand what could be causing this issue, I'm going to need to run some tests on your network connection. Would that be alright with you? 

Customer: 
Yes, that would be fine. How long will it take for these tests to complete? 

Agent: 
The tests should take about 10 minutes to complete and once they're finished, we'll have a better idea of what could be causing the issue with your internet connection. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime? 

 Customer:  No that should be it for now. Thanks for helping me out!
