Customer Service Agent: Welcome to Contoso Wireless! How may I help you today?

Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a new phone from your company and I have some questions about it.

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely, what can I help you with?

Customer: Well, I've been having some issues with the battery life. It seems to be draining much faster than it should be. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me see if I can help you troubleshoot this issue. Could you provide me with the model number of the phone so that I can investigate further? 

Customer: Sure, it's a Contoso Galaxy Edge Plus X model. 

Customer Service Agent: Great, thank you for that information. Could you tell me a bit more about the issue you're experiencing? 

Customer: Well, it's been draining really quickly, even when I'm not using it. It'll drop from full charge to around 20% within an hour or two. 

Customer Service Agent: That does sound like an unusual amount of battery drain. Is there anything else that you have noticed that may be related? 

Customer: Yes, my phone has been running slower than usual and crashing more often than before. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, that could be related to the battery drain issue. Let me take a look at some troubleshooting steps that we can try to help resolve this issue for you. Have you tried any steps on your own already? 

Customer: Yes, I've tried resetting the phone and uninstalling some of my apps but it didn't seem to make any difference. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, let's try something else then. Can you go into your phone settings and disable any unnecessary background apps or processes that may be running in the background? This could help reduce battery drain and improve performance as well. 

Customer: Sure, let me give that a try now and see if it helps. 

Customer Service Agent: Great! Please let me know if that works for you or if there is anything else I can do to help resolve this issue for you.
