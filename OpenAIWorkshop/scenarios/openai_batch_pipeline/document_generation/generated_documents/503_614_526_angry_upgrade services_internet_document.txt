Customer: "I've been trying to upgrade my internet service with Contoso Wireless for weeks now and I'm fed up. I just want it done already!"

Agent: "I understand your frustration, sir. I can certainly help you with that. Can you please provide me with your account number so that I can better assist you?"

Customer: "My account number is 1234-5678. Can you help me now?"

Agent: "Yes, absolutely. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Let's get started on upgrading your internet service. Do you know what speed and package you would like to upgrade to?"

Customer: "I want the fastest possible speed and the most reliable package."

Agent: "That's great. We have several packages available for upgrade, including our top-tier offering of 500 Mbps download speeds and 1 Gbps upload speeds. Would you like to upgrade to this package?"

Customer: "Yes, that sounds perfect."

Agent: "Great! All I need to do is confirm some details regarding your account and then we can proceed with the upgrade. Can you please confirm your address and phone number associated with the account?"

Customer: "My address is 123 Main Street, Anytown USA and my phone number is (123) 456-7890." 

Agent: "Thank you for confirming those details. Now, I just need to make sure that you're aware of any fees associated with the upgrade before we proceed. We charge a one-time activation fee of $49.99 and a monthly fee of $59.99 for this package." 

Customer: "$50 for activation? That's outrageous! Is there any way I can waive this fee?" 

Agent: "I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the activation fee, sir. Unfortunately, this fee is non-negotiable as it covers the cost of setting up and activating your new service plan. Would you like to proceed with the upgrade?" 

Customer: "Yes, let's just get it done already." 

Agent: "Great! The upgrade process should only take a few minutes and then your internet service will be up and running at its full capacity. Is there anything else I can do for you today?" 

Customer: "No, that should be it." 
 
Agent: "Excellent! I'm glad I was able to help get your internet upgraded today. Thank you for being a valued customer of Contoso Wireless and have a great day!"
