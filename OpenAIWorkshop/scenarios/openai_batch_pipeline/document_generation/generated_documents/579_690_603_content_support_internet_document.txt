Agent: Of course! What kind of problems are you having with your internet?

Customer: Well, I've been having difficulty connecting to the internet and my speeds are really slow. 

Agent: Alright, I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue? Is this happening on all devices or just one in particular? 

Customer: Just one device, my laptop. The other devices seem to be working fine. 

Agent: Okay, let's start by running some tests to see what might be causing the issue. First, can you confirm that the laptop is connected to Contoso Wireless network? 

Customer: Yes, it is connected to Contoso Wireless. 

Agent: Great! Now, let's check the speed of your connection. Can you please open a web browser and navigate to our speed test page? The link is contosowireless.net/speedtest. 

Customer: Sure, I'm on the page now. 

Agent: Excellent! Please click the "Start Test" button and wait for the results to appear. Once they do, can you tell me what your download and upload speeds are? 

Customer: My download speed is 8 Mbps and my upload speed is 2 Mbps. 

Agent: Okay, that's a bit lower than we'd like it to be. Let's try running a few more tests to see if we can identify the issue. Can you open the command prompt window on your laptop? You can do this by pressing Windows+R and then typing cmd into the box that appears. 

Customer: Sure thing, I'm in the command prompt window now. 

Agent: Great! Now please type in ipconfig /all and hit enter. Then can you tell me what IP address is listed next to Default Gateway? 

Customer: It says 192.168.1.1 

Agent: Perfect! Now let's run one more test to make sure that your connection is stable. Please type in ping 8.8.8.8 and hit enter again. Then tell me what is the result of this test? 

Customer: It says "Reply from 8.8.8.8 time=24ms TTL=54" 

Agent: That looks good! Based on the results of these tests, it looks like there may be an issue with your router settings or configuration that needs to be adjusted in order for you to get better speeds and a more stable connection.
