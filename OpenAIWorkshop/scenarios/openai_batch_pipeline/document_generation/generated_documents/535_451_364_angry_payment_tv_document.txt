Agent: Hi there, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Can you please provide me with your account number so that I can look into the issue further?

Customer: Sure, it's [account number]. Now tell me why am I being asked to pay more money?

Agent: Thank you for the account number. I understand your frustration. Let me take a closer look into the matter. Give me one moment while I review your account details. 

Customer: Hurry up! 

Agent: I apologize for the wait. After reviewing your account, it appears that the price of the TV was increased since the time of your purchase. This is due to a change in our pricing policy and unfortunately, we cannot honor the original price. 

Customer: That's not fair! You should have informed me about this beforehand. 

Agent: I understand your point of view and I apologize for any inconvenience caused. However, we do need to charge you the new price as it is our policy. 

Customer: That's just not right. How can you do this? 

Agent: We understand that this may be difficult for you to accept but unfortunately, we are unable to honor the original price due to our new pricing policy. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all. 

Agent: Is there anything else that I can do for you today? If not, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless and have a great day!
