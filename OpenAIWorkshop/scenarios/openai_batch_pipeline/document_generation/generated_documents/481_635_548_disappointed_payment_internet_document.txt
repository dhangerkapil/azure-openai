Customer: 
Hello, I'm having some issues with my internet connection. I'm having a hard time making payments and I'm very frustrated. Can you help me?

Contoso Wireless Agent: 
Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble making payments. We can certainly help you out. Can you tell me more about the issue?

Customer: 
I'm not sure what's going on. I've been trying to make a payment for my internet service for a few days now, but it's not going through. It keeps saying that something is wrong with my account, but I haven't been able to figure out what it is. 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Let's take a look and see if we can figure out what's going on. Can you please provide me with your account information so I can check on this for you? 

Customer: 
Sure, my account number is 1234-5678-9012 and my name is John Doe. 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 
Thank you for providing your account information, Mr. Doe. Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on here. Please give me one moment while I do so.

Contoso Wireless Agent: 
Ok, Mr. Doe, it looks like the issue with your payment is due to an expired credit card associated with your account. It looks like the card was last used in June of this year, which means it has now expired and needs to be updated in order for us to process your payment. 

Customer: 
Oh, I had no idea that my credit card had expired! Is there any way I can update my card information without having to cancel my service? 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 
Yes, of course! We can easily update your card information without having to cancel your service. All we need from you is the new card number and expiration date and we'll take care of the rest for you. 

Customer: 
Great! My new card number is 9012-3456-7890 and the expiration date is 12/2021. Is there anything else I need to do? 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 
No, that should do it! Once we have this information, we'll update your account and process your payment right away so that you can continue using our services without any interruption. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
