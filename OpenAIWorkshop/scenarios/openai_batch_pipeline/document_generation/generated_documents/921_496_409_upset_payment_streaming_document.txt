"Hello, I'm calling because I'm having trouble with my payment for Contoso Wireless. I signed up for the streaming product, but I never received it and my credit card was charged. Can you help me out?"

Agent: 

"Hi there! I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me your name and account number so that I can look into this for you?"

Customer: 

"My name is Mark and my account number is 72819. What do I need to do to get this resolved?"

Agent: 

"I understand your frustration, Mark. Let me take a look at your account and see what we can do. It looks like you signed up for the streaming product on June 18th, but we don't have any record of your payment being received. Do you have a receipt or any other proof of payment?"

Customer: 

"No, I don't have a receipt or any other proof of payment. I thought that when I signed up, my credit card would be charged automatically." 

Agent: 
"I apologize for the confusion. It looks like the payment was not processed due to a technical issue with our system. We will need to process your payment manually in order to get the streaming product activated on your account. Can I have your credit card details so that we can process the payment now?" 

 Customer: 
"Yes, sure. My credit card number is XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234."

 Agent: 
"Thank you for providing us with your credit card details. We will process the payment now and activate the streaming product on your account as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

 Customer: 
"No, that should be all for now. Thank you for helping me get this sorted out."

 Agent: 
"You're welcome! Have a great day!"
