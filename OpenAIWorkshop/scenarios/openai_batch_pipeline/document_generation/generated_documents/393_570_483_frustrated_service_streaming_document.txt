Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble with your product streaming service.

Agent: Hi there, I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please provide more details about the issue you're experiencing?

Customer: Well, when I try to access the product streaming service, it's not working. The loading screen keeps coming up and then it disappears.

Agent: I understand how frustrating that can be. Can you tell me what type of device you're using and what type of operating system? 

Customer: I'm using an iPhone 8 with iOS 11. 

Agent: Alright, let me see if I can help. Could you please try to restart your device and try again? 

Customer: Yes, I've already done that and it still isn't working. 

Agent: Hmm, that's strange. Could you please try to clear your cache and cookies and try again? 

Customer: Yes, I've done that too and it still isn't working. 

Agent: Okay, that's really strange. Can you tell me what type of internet connection you're using? 

Customer: Yes, I'm using a wireless connection from my home network. 

Agent: Alright, let me see if I can help further. Could you please try to disconnect from your home network and try to connect to another network? 

Customer: Yes, I've already tried that too and it still isn't working. 

Agent: Hmm, this is really strange. Can you tell me what type of browser you're using? 

Customer: Yes, I'm using Google Chrome on my iPhone 8. 

Agent: Alright, could you please try to switch to a different browser such as Safari or Firefox and try again? 

Customer: Yes, I've already tried both of those browsers and it still isn't working. 

Agent: Okay, this is really strange. Can you please try to reset your router and then try again? 

Customer: Yes, I've already done that too and it still isn't working. 

 Agent: Alright, let me check something else on our end and then we'll take it from there. Could you please stay on the line while I check something out? 

 Customer: Sure thing!
