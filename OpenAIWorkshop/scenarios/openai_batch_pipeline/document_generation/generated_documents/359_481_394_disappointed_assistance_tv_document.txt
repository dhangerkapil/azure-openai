Hi, I recently bought a TV from Contoso Wireless and I'm having some trouble with it. Can you help me?

Agent:
Hello! Thank you for choosing Contoso Wireless. We are happy to help. Can you please tell us what kind of issues you are having with your TV?

Customer:
Yes, I'm having trouble with the picture quality. The colors seem off and the picture is grainy. It's not what I expected when I bought it. 

Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. We take pride in providing our customers with the best products possible and we're sorry that you weren't satisfied with your purchase. Is there anything else that we can help you with? 

Customer:
Yes, I was wondering if there's anything that can be done to improve the picture quality? Is there a software update or something? 

Agent:
Let me check on that for you. In the meantime, have you tried adjusting the settings on your TV? This can often help to improve the picture quality and make adjustments to color and contrast settings. 

Customer:
I've tried adjusting the settings but it doesn't seem to help much. Are there any other options? 

Agent:
Yes, we do have some other options available to improve your picture quality. We can send a technician out to inspect your TV and make any necessary adjustments or repairs if needed. We can also provide software updates if necessary, which can sometimes help to improve picture quality. 

Customer:
That would be great! How soon can someone come out to inspect my TV? 

Agent:
We can usually send a technician out within 24-48 hours depending on availability in your area. Would this work for you? 

Customer:
Yes, that would be perfect! Thank you for your help!
