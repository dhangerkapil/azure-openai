Customer: Hi John. I recently purchased one of your TVs and was wondering if you could help me with some questions I have about the product?

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! What questions do you have about the TV?

Customer: Well, first off, I want to know what kind of warranty comes with the product.

Customer Service Agent: Sure thing! Our TVs come with a one-year limited warranty that covers any manufacturer defects. It also covers any parts and labor required to repair the TV during the warranty period.

Customer: That's great! Is there any way to extend the warranty?

Customer Service Agent: Yes, there is. We offer an extended warranty plan that will cover your TV for an additional two years. The cost for this plan is $99. 

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. What about customer service? Do you offer any help if I need assistance with setting up or using my TV?
