Customer:
Hello, I am not happy with the streaming service Contoso Wireless offers. I have had nothing but issues with it. I can't seem to get it to work and when I do, the quality is terrible. I would like to know what can be done to fix this issue. 

Agent:
Hello there! We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with our streaming service. Can you please provide us with some more details about the issue you are having so that we can investigate further?

Customer:
Sure. When I try to stream a video, it will start playing and then freeze after a few seconds. The video will not continue playing and I'm stuck on the same frame until I refresh the page. The sound will also become distorted. 

Agent:
We understand your frustration and we apologize for any inconvenience caused. We would like to take a closer look at your account in order to better understand the issue you are experiencing and find a solution. Can you please provide us with your account number so that we can look into this? 

Customer:
Yes, my account number is 84736-2739. 

Agent:
Thank you for providing us with your account number. We will take a look at your account and investigate further in order to find a solution for your issue. In the meantime, we suggest trying a different web browser or device to see if that helps with the issue you are experiencing. 

Customer: 
I have already tried different web browsers and devices but none of them have worked. Is there anything else that can be done? 

Agent: 
Of course! We suggest restarting your router or modem as this may help resolve the issue you are experiencing. Additionally, we recommend clearing your cache and cookies as this may also help resolve any technical issues that may be causing this problem. 

Customer: 
I have already tried those steps but they didn't seem to help. Is there anything else that can be done?
