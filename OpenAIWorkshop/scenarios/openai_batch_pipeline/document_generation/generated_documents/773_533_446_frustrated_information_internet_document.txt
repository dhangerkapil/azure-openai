Customer Service Agent: Hi there, my name is John and I'm a customer service agent with Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi John. I need some information about your internet service.

Customer Service Agent: Sure, what do you need to know?

Customer: Well, I've been trying to figure out what kind of speeds your internet service provides and how much it costs.

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely, we offer various packages that vary in speed and price. We have a package that offers up to 50 Mbps for $59.99 per month. We also have a package that offers up to 100 Mbps for $79.99 per month. 

Customer: Okay, so those are the two options then? That's kind of expensive compared to other companies. 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, those are the two main packages we offer, however, we do have additional options such as bundle packages that include additional services like TV or phone services at discounted rates. 

Customer: That's still pretty pricey compared to what other companies are offering. Is there anything else you can do to make it more affordable? 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, we do have promotional offers available for new customers that can help make our services more affordable. If you sign up for one of our packages today, you can get 3 months of service for half the price. 

Customer: That's still not really what I was hoping for but it's better than nothing. Can you tell me anything else about the internet service itself? 

Customer Service Agent: Sure, all of our internet packages come with unlimited data usage and no long-term contracts or hidden fees. We also offer 24/7 customer support if you ever have any issues with your service. 

Customer: That's good to know. One last question - what kind of equipment do I need in order to use your internet service? 

Customer Service Agent: You will need a modem and router in order to use our service. We can provide these items for an additional fee or you can purchase them separately from an electronics store.
