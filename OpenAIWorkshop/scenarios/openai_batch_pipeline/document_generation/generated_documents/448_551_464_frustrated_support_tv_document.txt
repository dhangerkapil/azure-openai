"Hello, I'm having a really hard time with my Contoso Wireless TV. It keeps cutting out and freezing and it's really frustrating. Is there anything you can do to help me out?"

Agent:
"Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your Contoso Wireless TV. We take pride in providing our customers with the best possible service, so let's see what we can do to help. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue?"

Customer:
"Well, every time I turn on the TV it will start to freeze and cut out after a few minutes. It's very frustrating because it happens every time."

Agent:
"I understand how frustrating this must be for you. I'll do my best to help you get this issue resolved as quickly as possible. Can you tell me what model of Contoso Wireless TV you have?"

Customer:
"It's the latest model, the Contoso Wireless X500."

Agent:
"Ok, let me take a look at that model and see if there are any known issues with it. Could you please hold while I check?"

Customer: 
"Sure, no problem." 

Agent: 
"Thanks for your patience. It looks like there may be a software issue with the X500 model. I'd recommend that you try doing a factory reset on your TV and see if that helps. Do you need help with the reset process?" 

Customer: 
"Yes please, that would be great!" 

Agent: 
"No problem. I'll walk you through it step-by-step. First, press and hold the power button on your remote for 10 seconds until the TV turns off completely. Then press and hold the volume up button while turning the TV back on. You should then see a menu on your screen with a list of options. Select 'Factory Reset' and then follow the instructions on your screen." 

Customer: 
"Ok, got it! Let me try that now." 

Agent: 
"Great! Let me know how it goes and if you need any more help just let me know."
