Agent: Hi there! I'm happy to help. What seems to be the issue with the streaming service?

Customer: Well, I'm having difficulty connecting to the streaming service and staying connected. I've tried restarting my device multiple times but nothing is working.

Agent: I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Let me see if I can help. Could you tell me what type of device you are using to access the streaming service? 

Customer: Yes, I am using an iPhone 11 Pro Max. 

Agent: Alright, great. Are you able to connect to other networks or applications on your device? 

Customer: Yes, I can connect to other applications and networks, just not the streaming service. 

Agent: Alright, that helps narrow down the issue. Have you tried clearing your cache or restarting your device? 

Customer: Yes, I have done both multiple times but it still isn't working. 

Agent: Alright, let's try something else then. Can you try connecting to a different network and see if that helps? 

Customer: Yes, I will try that now. 

Agent: Great! Please let me know if that doesn't work and we can try something else. 

Customer: Okay, I'll let you know what happens.
