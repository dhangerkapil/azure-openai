Customer:
"I just got my new Contoso Wireless phone and I am already having trouble with it. I wanted to upgrade my services but now it seems like I have been downgraded. Can you explain why this happened?"

Agent:
"I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please provide me with some more information about your phone so that I can better understand the issue?"

Customer: 
"I purchased the latest Contoso Wireless model and signed up for the premium package. Now, I'm being charged for a lower tier plan and I'm not sure why."

Agent: 
"Thank you for providing me with the additional information. Let me take a look at your account and see what I can do to help." 

Customer: 
"That would be great. What could have caused this downgrade in services?"

Agent: 
"It looks like the issue is due to an incorrect billing code in your account. We'll need to update your account information in order to restore your original services." 

Customer: 
"So, what do I need to do to make sure this doesn't happen again?" 

Agent: 
"I can make sure that the billing code is updated in your account so that you will not experience any further issues. In addition, I can provide you with a complimentary upgrade of your services for one month as an apology for the inconvenience." 

Customer: 
"That would be great. How do I go about doing that?" 

Agent: 
"I will need to get some additional information from you in order to update your account. Could you please provide me with your name, address, and phone number?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, of course. My name is John Smith, my address is 123 Main Street, and my phone number is (555) 555-5555." 

Agent: 
"Thank you for providing me with the necessary information. I will go ahead and update your account now. Please allow up to 24 hours for the changes to take effect."
