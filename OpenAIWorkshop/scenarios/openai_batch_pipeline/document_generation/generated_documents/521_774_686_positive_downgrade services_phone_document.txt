Customer: Hi, I’m looking to downgrade my service plan with Contoso Wireless. I need some help understanding what the differences between the plans are and how it will affect my phone.

Agent: Hi there, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless! I'm happy to help you understand the differences between our service plans. Can you tell me a bit more about your current plan and why you are looking to downgrade?

Customer: Sure. I’m currently on the Contoso Plus plan, which is great for my needs, but I’ve been looking to save a bit of money each month. I’d still like to have access to all the same features, but just with a lower cost.

Agent: Absolutely! Let me see what we can do for you. The Contoso Plus plan offers unlimited talk, text, and data plus additional features such as HD streaming and mobile hotspot. Are these features something that you still want included in your new plan?

Customer: Yes, those are important features for me so I would like to keep them in my new plan if possible.

Agent: Perfect! We have several plans that offer unlimited talk, text, and data with HD streaming and mobile hotspot included. The main difference between these plans is the data speed, which varies from 3G up to 4G LTE depending on the plan. Additionally, some of our plans offer extra benefits such as discounts on accessories or device protection plans. Which of these options are you interested in?

Customer: That's great! I think a 4G LTE plan would be perfect for me and I'm interested in any additional benefits that come with it. 

Agent: Wonderful! We have several 4G LTE plans available that offer all the features you mentioned plus discounts on accessories and device protection plans. Do any of these sound like a good fit for you? 

Customer: Yes, those sound great! Can you tell me more about how much data I get with each plan? 

Agent: Absolutely! All of our 4G LTE plans come with unlimited data plus an additional 10GB of high-speed data each month. This means that any usage over 10GB will be reduced to 3G speeds until your next billing cycle. Does this sound like something that will work for you? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds perfect! Can you explain how much each plan costs? 

Agent: Certainly! Our basic 4G LTE plan costs $49/month plus taxes and fees while our premium 4G LTE plan costs $79/month plus taxes and fees. Both plans include unlimited talk, text, data plus an additional 10GB of high-speed data each month as well as discounts on accessories and device protection plans. Does this sound like something you're interested in? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds great! Do you think I can keep my current phone number if I switch to one of these new plans? 

Agent: Absolutely! We can easily transfer your current phone number over to your new service plan so you don't have to worry about changing it out or updating your contacts list. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all I needed help with today! Thank you so much for all your help.
