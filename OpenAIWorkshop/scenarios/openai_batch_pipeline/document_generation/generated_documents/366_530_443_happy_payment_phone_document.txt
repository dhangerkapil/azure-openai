Agent: Hi there, great to hear you're interested in purchasing a new phone from Contoso Wireless. We have a few different payment options that you can choose from. Would you like me to explain them to you?

Customer: Sure, that would be great!

Agent: Alright. We accept all major credit cards, as well as PayPal, Venmo, and Apple Pay. We also offer a financing option through our partner Affirm which allows customers to spread out the cost of their purchase over multiple months with 0% APR. Lastly, we accept cash payments at our store locations if you prefer. Does this help answer your question?

Customer: Yes, thank you! That's really helpful. I think I'm leaning towards using my credit card to pay for the phone. What kind of information do I need to provide for that?

Agent: No problem! All we need is the name on the card, the card number, expiration date, and security code on the back of the card. We also need your billing address and phone number associated with the card. Once we have that information, we'll be able to process your payment quickly and securely. 

Customer: Got it! That's all pretty straightforward. 

Agent: Great! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: Actually, yes. I was wondering what kind of phone you have available? Do you have any recommendations for me? 

Agent: Absolutely! We have a wide selection of phones ranging from budget-friendly models to top-of-the-line flagship devices. It really depends on what you're looking for in terms of features and price point. Do you know what kind of phone you're looking for? 

Customer: Yeah, I'm looking for something with a good camera and lots of storage space but still fairly affordable. 

Agent: Got it! We have several models that fit that criteria. Let me show you a few of our top picksâ€¦
