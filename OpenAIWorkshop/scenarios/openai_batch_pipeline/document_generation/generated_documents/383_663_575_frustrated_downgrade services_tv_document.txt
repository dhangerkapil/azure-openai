Customer: Hi there, I'm calling about my Contoso Wireless service. I recently downgraded my services and now I'm not able to get the channels I wanted. I was hoping to get some help.

Agent: Hi there, I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me see if I can help you out. What kind of service are you trying to access?

Customer: I'm trying to get TV channels.

Agent: Okay, so you're looking to access TV channels with your Contoso Wireless services?

Customer: Yes, that's right. I recently downgraded my services and now I'm not able to get the channels that I wanted.

Agent: I understand. Let me take a look at your account to see what's going on. Can you provide me with your account number?

Customer: Sure, it's [account number].

Agent: Thanks for that information. Let me take a look here and see what we can do for you.

[A few moments of silence while the agent looks up the customer's account.]

Agent: Okay, I'm seeing here that when you downgraded your services, you lost access to certain TV channels that were previously included in your package. Is this correct? 

Customer: Yes, that's right. Why is that? Can't I just get those channels back? 

Agent: Unfortunately, no. When you downgrade your services, certain features are removed from your package and you can't add them back without upgrading again. However, we do have other packages available that may be more suitable for you and include the channels you're looking for. Would you like me to go over them with you? 

Customer: Yes, please do. 

Agent: Great! We have several different packages available ranging from basic to premium service with varying levels of access to TV channels. Which one would you like me to explain in more detail? 

Customer: The premium one please. 

Agent: Sure thing! Our premium package includes access to over 100 HD channels, including all the major networks as well as sports and movie channels, plus access to our on-demand library which has thousands of titles available for streaming or downloading. You'll also get access to our advanced DVR capabilities which allow you to record multiple shows at once and store them on our cloud-based storage system so they're always accessible wherever you go. Would this be something you're interested in? 

Customer: That sounds great! How much does it cost? 

Agent: The premium package costs $79.99 per month plus applicable taxes and fees. Is this something you'd like to sign up for? 

Customer: Yes, please sign me up for the premium package!
