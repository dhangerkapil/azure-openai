"Hello, I just purchased a Contoso Wireless phone and it's not working! I'm really angry right now. What do you plan to do about it?"

Agent: 

"I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please tell me what kind of issue you are having with your phone?"

Customer: 

"It won't even turn on! It was working fine yesterday, and now it's completely dead."

Agent: 

"I understand how frustrating this must be. Can you please tell me what model phone you have?"

Customer: 

"It's the Contoso Wireless XT-35. I just bought it a few days ago and now it's completely useless!"

"I can have a new phone sent out to you within 2-3 business days. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
