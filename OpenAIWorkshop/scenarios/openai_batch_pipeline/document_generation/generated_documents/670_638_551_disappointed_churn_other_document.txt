Agent: Hi there, sorry to hear you're unhappy with our product. We do offer several other products that may be a better fit for you. Would you like to hear more about them?

Customer: Yes, please tell me more about the other products you have available.

Agent: Sure! We have a few different plans that you can choose from depending on your needs. Our basic plan is great for those who just need basic coverage and access to a few basic features. Our premium plan offers more features and coverage, as well as access to our customer service team 24/7. And our ultimate plan offers the most features and coverage available, plus unlimited customer service support. 

Customer: That sounds great! Can you tell me more about the features of each plan? 

Agent: Absolutely! Our basic plan offers coverage in all 50 states, with access to a few key features such as call forwarding, voicemail, and text messaging. The premium plan includes everything in the basic plan, plus access to our mobile app, online account management tools, and unlimited customer service support. The ultimate plan includes all of the features of the premium plan, plus additional features such as international calling and roaming capabilities. 

Customer: That sounds like a great selection of plans. What about customer service? Do I get access to customer service with any of these plans? 

Agent: Yes, absolutely! With our basic plan, you'll have access to our customer service team during regular business hours. With the premium and ultimate plans, you'll have access to our customer service team 24/7. 

Customer: That's great! One last question - what are your cancellation policies? 

Agent: We understand that life can change quickly and sometimes you need to make changes to your plan or cancel altogether. We make it easy for customers to cancel their plans without any penalties or fees. All you have to do is call or email us at least 7 days before your billing cycle ends and we'll process your cancellation request right away. 

Customer: That's really helpful - thank you! I think I'm going to give Contoso Wireless another chance and see if one of your other plans is a better fit for me. 

Agent: Great! We're glad that we could help answer your questions and make sure that you find the right plan for your needs. If there's anything else we can do for you, please don't hesitate to reach out!
