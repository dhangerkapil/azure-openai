Customer: Sure. The internet keeps going in and out, and it's really slow. I've tried resetting the router, but that doesn't seem to help.

Customer: Yes, I have contacted them multiple times but they haven't been able to fix the problem.

Agent: That's definitely not what we want for you. I'd like to look into this further for you if you're open to it. Can you provide me with more details on the issue so that I can better assist you?

Customer: Yes, of course. Basically, my internet connection is slow and unreliable. It will work for a few minutes then suddenly disconnect or become incredibly slow. I have tried restarting my router multiple times but it doesn't seem to help.

Agent: Alright, thank you for providing me with more information on the issue. Our tech support team should be able to help resolve this issue for you, however if they are unable to do so, we can look into other options such as changing your plan or upgrading your router. 

Customer: That would be great! Do you think that would help?
