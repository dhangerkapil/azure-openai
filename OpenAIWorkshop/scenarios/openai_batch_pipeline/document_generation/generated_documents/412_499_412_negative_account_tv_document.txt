Customer: I recently signed up for Contoso Wireless, and I'm having a lot of issues with my account. I've been trying to watch TV but the signal keeps dropping out. Can you help?

Agent: Absolutely, I'm sorry to hear you're having issues with your account. Let's see if we can get this sorted out for you. Can you tell me what device you're using to watch TV? 

Customer: I'm using a Samsung Smart TV. 

Agent: Alright, that should work perfectly with our service. Have you already gone through the setup process on your TV? 

Customer: Yes, I have. I even tried resetting it several times, but the signal still keeps dropping out. 

Agent: Hmm, that's strange. Do you have any other devices connected to your Contoso Wireless account? 

Customer: Yes, I have two phones and a tablet connected as well. 

Agent: Ok, let's try troubleshooting the issue on your TV first. Could you please turn off all other devices connected to your account and try watching TV again? This will help us isolate the issue. 

Customer: Alright, I'll do that now. 

Agent: Great! Please let me know if the issue persists after turning off all other devices connected to your account. 

Customer: Okay, will do.

 Customer: Alright, I've turned off all the other devices and the signal is still dropping out on my TV. 

 Agent: Okay, it sounds like we may need to reset your router to see if that helps. Can you please go ahead and unplug your router from power for at least one minute and then plug it back in? 

 Customer: Sure thing. Let me just do that now. 

 Agent: Great! Please let me know once it's been reset and we can check if that resolves the issue with your TV.
