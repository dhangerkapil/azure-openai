Customer Service Agent: Hi, this is [Name], from Contoso Wireless. How can I help you?

Customer: Hi [Name], I'm having some trouble with my Contoso Wireless tv and was hoping to get some support. 

Customer Service Agent: Sure, what seems to be the issue?

Customer: The sound isn't working properly. The volume keeps cutting in and out. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take a look at your tv's settings and see if we can find a solution. Can you please provide me with the model number and serial number of your device? 

Customer: Sure, the model number is CWTV-2020-3, and the serial number is 8457548-O8A1. 

Customer Service Agent: Great, thank you for that information. Can you please tell me how long this issue has been going on? 

Customer: It's been happening for about a week now. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let me take a look at the settings and see if I can find a solution. In the meantime, can you please confirm that all of your cables are securely connected? 

Customer: Yes, everything is connected properly. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, thanks for confirming that. Let me go ahead and check out the settings on your device now. Please hold while I do so. 

[Pause] 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, I've had a look at the settings and it appears that the problem is with your speaker settings. It looks like they were set to low by default which could be causing the volume to cut in and out. Can you please try adjusting the volume setting to a higher level and let me know if that resolves the issue? 

Customer: Sure thing! I'll give it a try now and let you know how it goes. 

[Pause] 

Customer: Okay, that did the trick! The sound is back up and running perfectly now! Thank you so much for your help! 

Customer Service Agent: You're very welcome! I'm glad we were able to get it sorted out quickly. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
