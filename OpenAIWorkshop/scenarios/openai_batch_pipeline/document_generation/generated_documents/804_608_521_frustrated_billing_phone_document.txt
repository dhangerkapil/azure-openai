Hello, I'm having some issues with my billing for my Contoso Wireless phone. I'm not sure why the amount is so high. Can you please help me?

Agent: 

Hello there! I apologize for the confusion regarding your billing. Can you please provide me with a bit more information so that I can look into this further?

Customer: 

Sure, I've had the phone for almost a month now and the bill has been extremely high. It's much more than what I expected when I signed up for the service. 

Agent: 

I understand your concern. Let me take a look at your account and see what could be causing the issue. Can you tell me which type of plan you have? 

Customer: 

Yes, I have the Contoso Wireless Family Plan with unlimited data. 

Agent: 

Ok, thank you for that information. Let me take a look at your account to see what could be causing the higher bill. Please give me just one moment while I investigate this issue further. 

Customer: 
Ok, that sounds great. Is there anything else you need from me? 

Agent: 
No, that should do it for now. I'll be right back with some more information on your billing issue. 

(A few moments later) 

 Agent: Alright, I've taken a look at your account and it looks like one of the phones in your plan has been using significantly more data than usual this month, which is causing your bill to be higher than normal. Do you know which phone might be responsible for this extra usage?  

 Customer: Yes, it's my teenage son's phone. He's been streaming videos and playing games nonstop lately and I'm sure that's what's causing the extra data usage. 

 Agent: Alright, thank you for confirming that information. To help reduce your bill in the future, I would recommend setting up some limits on his data usage or switching him to a different plan that has lower data caps if he's using more than he needs to. Would you like any assistance setting up those restrictions?  

 Customer: Yes please, that would be great! Can you walk me through how to do it? 

 Agent: Absolutely! Setting up data restrictions is easy and only takes a few minutes to complete. Let me walk you through it now so that you can start saving money on your bill in no time!
