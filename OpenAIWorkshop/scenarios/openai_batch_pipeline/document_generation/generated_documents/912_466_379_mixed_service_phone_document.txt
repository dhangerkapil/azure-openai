Welcome to Contoso Wireless. How may I help you?

Customer:

Hi, I recently purchased a phone from your company and I am having some issues with it. Can you help me? 

Customer Service Agent: 

Absolutely! What seems to be the problem? 

Customer: 

Well, the battery isn't lasting very long and it's not charging properly. Is there anything I can do to fix this? 

Customer Service Agent: 

I understand. Let's take a look at what we can do. First, let's try resetting the phone and then check if the battery is still not holding a charge. 

Customer: 

Ok, I've done that and it still isn't working properly. What else can I do? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Let's try a different power source to see if that helps. Can you plug it in to a different power source or outlet? 

Customer: 
Yes, I've tried that and it still isn't working. What else can we do? 

Customer Service Agent: 
It sounds like the issue might be with the battery itself. We offer a 30-day warranty on our phones so you can exchange it for a new one or receive a refund if you wish. Would that work for you?  

Customer: 
Yes, that would work. Can you walk me through how to do that? 

 Customer Service Agent:  Of course! All you need to do is bring your phone into one of our retail stores and they will take care of everything for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

 Customer: No, that should be all for now. Thanks for your help!
