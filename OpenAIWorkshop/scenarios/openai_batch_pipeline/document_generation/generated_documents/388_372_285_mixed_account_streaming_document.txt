Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble streaming content on my account. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent: Of course, I'd be happy to help. Can you tell me what type of streaming service you are using? 

Customer: I'm using the Contoso Wireless streaming service. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, let's see what we can do. Is your device connected to a Wi-Fi network? 

Customer: Yes, it is. 

Customer Service Agent: Great. Could you try restarting the device and then connecting to the Wi-Fi network again? 

Customer: Yes, I did that but it's still not working. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let's take a look at your account settings. Could you please provide me with your account information so that I can access it? 

Customer: Sure, here it is. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you. Let me take a look at your settings. Hmm...it looks like the streaming service was disabled on your account. I've enabled it now so it should work properly now. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should do it. Thanks for your help!
