Customer:

Hello, I am so frustrated with Contoso Wireless. I recently downgraded my service plan and now I'm not getting the streaming product that I was promised. Can you please explain what happened?

Agent:

Good afternoon, I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please provide me with some more information about your account so I can look into this further for you? 

Customer:

Yes, my name is John Doe and my account number is 123456. 

Agent:

Thank you for providing the information, Mr. Doe. Let me take a moment to pull up your account and see what's going on here. Please bear with me for a few moments while I investigate this further. 

Customer: 
Ok, thank you. 

Agent: 
I've reviewed your account and it looks like when you downgraded your service plan, you no longer have access to the streaming product that was included in your previous plan. Is that correct? 

Customer: 
Yes, that's correct. But why wasn't I informed of this before downgrading? It seems like false advertising to me. 

Agent: 
I apologize if you were not aware of this change before downgrading your service plan. We do our best to make sure our customers are aware of any changes that could affect their plans. However, I understand why you feel frustrated and would like to offer a solution to help make this situation better for you. 

 Customer: 
What kind of solution do you have in mind? 

 Agent: 
We can offer you a discounted rate on the streaming product for the duration of your current service plan. That way, you'll still be able to enjoy the product at a discounted rate until your plan expires and then you can decide whether or not to upgrade or downgrade again at that time. Does that sound like something that would work for you?
