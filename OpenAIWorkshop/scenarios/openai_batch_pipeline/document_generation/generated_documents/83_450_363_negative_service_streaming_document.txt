Agent: Hi there! Of course we can help. What seems to be the issue?

Customer: Well, I've been trying to stream a movie but it keeps buffering and freezing. It's really frustrating. 

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what device you're using and what kind of connection you have? 

Customer: I'm using an iPhone 11 and I have a strong wifi connection. 

Agent: Alright, let's see if we can figure this out. Can you try resetting your device and then reconnecting to your wifi network? 

Customer: I already tried that and it didn't work. 

Agent: No worries. Can you try clearing the cache of the streaming app? That should help with any buffering issues. 

Customer: Alright, I'll try that. 

Agent: Great! Please let me know if that doesn't work and we can look into other potential solutions. 

Customer: OK, thanks. 

[After clearing the cache] 
Customer: OK, I cleared the cache but it's still not working. 

Agent: Hmm, alright let's see what else we can do. Have you tried restarting your router? That could be causing some interference with your connection. 

Customer: No, I haven't tried that yet. 

Agent: That could definitely help improve the connection so let's give it a try. Can you please restart your router and then try streaming again? 

Customer: OK, I'll do that now. Thanks for your help!
