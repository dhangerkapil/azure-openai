Hello, I am a customer of Contoso Wireless and I am very disappointed with the product. I'm having trouble with it and I need assistance. Could you help me?

Agent: 

Hello there! We at Contoso Wireless are sorry to hear that you're having difficulty with our product. We are here to help you in any way we can. Can you tell me more about what you're having trouble with?

Customer: 

Yes, I'm having issues connecting the device to my phone. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps but nothing seems to work. 

Agent: 

I understand that must be frustrating. Let's see if we can get this sorted out for you. Have you checked that your device is compatible with your phone? That could be an issue. 

Customer: 

Yes, I've checked and it should be compatible. I've also updated the software and tried resetting the device, but still nothing. 

Agent: 

I see. It sounds like you've tried all the necessary steps so far. Have you asked your phone provider if they have any additional tips or tricks that could help? It might be something specific to their network. 

Customer: 
Yes, my phone provider said they don't support Contoso Wireless devices and they weren't able to help me further. So I'm really stuck here and don't know what else to do. 

Agent: 
I apologize that your phone provider was unable to help you further, but don't worry - we're here for you! We'll do our best to get this sorted out for you. Is there anything else you can tell me about the issue? Do you have any error messages or codes appearing on your device? 

Customer: 
Yes, I have an error code of '0x0004f9' appearing on the screen when I try to connect it to my phone. Does that mean anything to you? 

Agent: 
It does! That error code indicates a problem with the connection settings on your device, which is likely why it isn't connecting properly to your phone. We can walk through a few steps together that should help resolve this issue for you - would that be okay?
