Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble with my streaming service. I recently upgraded and now it's not working. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi there! My name is [Name], and I'm a customer service representative for Contoso Wireless. I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your streaming service. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue?

Customer: Well, it's been buffering and stalling a lot lately, even when I have full bars of service. It was working fine before I upgraded, but now it's just not reliable at all. 

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. When did you upgrade your service? 

Customer: About two weeks ago. 

Agent: Alright, let me take a look into this for you and see what could be causing the issue. Could you please provide me with your account number so that I can access your account? 

Customer: Sure, here it is [account number]. 

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. I'm now accessing your account and taking a look at the details of your upgrade. It appears that there have been some changes to our streaming service that could be causing the issues you're experiencing. Would you like me to walk you through these changes? 

Customer: Yes, please do. 

Agent: Alright, the first change we've made is to our data speeds - we've increased them significantly, which should improve your streaming experience overall. We've also added more channels to our streaming service, which should give you more options for entertainment. Finally, we've made some improvements to our streaming technology to reduce buffering and stalling issues. Does that sound like something that would help? 

Customer: That sounds great, but why wasn't I told about these changes before upgrading? It seems like they could have been mentioned in order to avoid this problem in the first place. 

Agent: I apologize if this wasn't made clear to you before upgrading - we strive to keep our customers informed of any changes we make to our services. We also have an FAQ page on our website where customers can find detailed information about any changes we make or new features we introduce. Would you like me to provide you with a link to this page? 

Customer: Yes, please do - that would be great. 

Agent: No problem! Here is the link to our FAQ page - [link]. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, thank you for your help. That should do it for now. 

Agent: My pleasure! Have a great day!
