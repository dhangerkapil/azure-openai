Hello, I'm looking to upgrade my phone with Contoso Wireless and I was wondering if you could help me?

Agent: 
Hello, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. It's our pleasure to help you with your upgrade. What type of phone are you looking to upgrade to?

Customer: 
I'm interested in the latest model of the Galaxy S20. Do you have any of those in stock?

Agent: 
Yes, we do have a few Galaxy S20s available for purchase. Would you like to hear about some of the features that come with it?

Customer: 
That would be great. I want to make sure I get the best deal for my money. 

Agent: 
Absolutely! The Galaxy S20 comes with a 6.2-inch Infinity-O display, a triple camera system, and 5G capability. It also has an all-day battery life and is water-resistant. Are there any other features you would like to know about? 

Customer: 
That sounds great. How much does it cost and what kind of payment plans do you offer? 

Agent: 
The Galaxy S20 retails for $999 and we offer several payment plans that can help make it more affordable. We have an installment plan where you can pay in monthly installments over 24 months or an Early Upgrade plan that allows you to upgrade after 12 months with no additional fees. Which plan would you like to learn more about? 

Customer: 
I think I would be interested in the installment plan. Can you tell me more about that? 

Agent: 
Sure! With our installment plan, you can spread out the cost of your purchase over 24 months with no down payment or credit check required. You'll be able to make payments each month with no interest charges or hidden fees. Does this sound like something that would work for you? 

Customer: 
That sounds perfect! Can I sign up for this plan now? 

Agent: 
Absolutely! I can get you set up right away. All I need is your contact information and a form of payment and we'll get you all set up with your new phone.
