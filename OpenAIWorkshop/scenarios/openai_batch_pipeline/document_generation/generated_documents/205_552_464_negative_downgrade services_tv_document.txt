Hello, I'm calling because I have a problem with my service. I recently downgraded my plan with Contoso Wireless and I am having issues with my TV service. Can you help me?

Agent:

Hello, this is [Agent Name] from Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer: 

I recently downgraded my plan and now I am having trouble with my TV service. It's not working properly and I'm not sure why. 

Agent: 

I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take a look into this for you. Could you please provide me with your account information so that I can review your account? 

Customer: 

Sure, my account number is [12345]. 

Agent: 

Thank you for providing your account information. I see that you recently downgraded your plan from our premium to our basic plan. This plan does not include access to our premium channels. Therefore, that could be why you are experiencing issues with your TV service. 

Customer: 

That doesn't make sense though. Why would downgrading my plan mean that I wouldn't be able to access the premium channels? That's the main reason why I wanted to downgrade in the first place! 

Agent: 
I understand your frustration. Our premium plan includes access to our premium channels while our basic plan does not. This is something that is clearly stated in our terms and conditions when signing up for either of the plans. If you would like to access these channels, you will need to upgrade your plan back to the premium one. 

 Customer: 
 But that's not fair! Why should I have to pay more money just to get access to the same channels that were included in my previous plan? That's not right! 

 Agent: 
I understand your concerns and apologize for any confusion or inconvenience caused. However, as stated in our terms and conditions, each plan has different levels of service and features associated with it. Therefore, if you would like access to our premium channels, you will need to upgrade your plan back to the premium one. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
