Customer: Hello. I recently bought a Contoso Wireless TV and it's not working. I'm very frustrated. Can you help me? 

Agent: Hi there! I apologize for the inconvenience. We want to make sure that you are satisfied with your purchase. Can you please tell me what seems to be the problem? 

Customer: Yes, the TV won't turn on at all. The remote doesn't work either. 

Agent: That is not good. Let's try and figure out what is going on. Can you please provide me with your serial number so that I can look into it further? 

Customer: Sure, it's xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx 

Agent: Perfect, thank you for that information. Please give me a few moments to take a look at this and see what we can do to help resolve the issue. 

Customer: Alright, I'm waiting...

Agent: Okay, so I can see from the serial number that this TV is still under warranty and we should be able to replace it for you without any issue. Can you please provide me with your address so I can get this process started? 

Customer: Yes, my address is xxx Main Street, xxx City, xxx State xxxxx. 

Agent: Perfect, thank you for providing me with that information. We will be shipping out a new TV as soon as possible and we will make sure that you have it within 3 business days. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should be all. Thank you for your help! 

Agent: You are very welcome! Please let us know if there is anything else we can do to assist you in the future. Have a great day!
