Customer Service Agent: Hi there, how can I help you today? 

Customer: Yes, I need to talk to someone about a problem I'm having with the Contoso Wireless TV. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. What seems to be the issue? 

Customer: Well, I bought the TV a few weeks ago and it keeps turning off randomly. It's really annoying. 

Customer Service Agent: I understand that this must be frustrating. Could you please provide me with the serial number of your TV? 

Customer: Yes, it's 1234567890. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for providing that information. Let me check on this for you and see what we can do to help. Can you please hold for a few moments while I look into this? 

Customer: Sure, no problem. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, thank you for your patience. It looks like the issue is with your power source and not the TV itself. We suggest getting a new power source to ensure optimal performance of your Contoso Wireless TV. 

Customer: That's ridiculous! Why would I have to buy a new power source when I just bought the TV a few weeks ago?

Customer Service Agent: We understand that this is not ideal and we apologize again for any inconvenience this may cause. We suggest replacing the power source as soon as possible in order to ensure optimal performance of your Contoso Wireless TV.
