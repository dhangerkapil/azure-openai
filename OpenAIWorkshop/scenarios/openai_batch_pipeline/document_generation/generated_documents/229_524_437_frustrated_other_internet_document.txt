Customer: 
Hello, I'm having trouble with the internet connection I purchased from Contoso Wireless. It's been dropping out and disconnecting every few minutes. Can you help me with this issue?

Agent:
Hello, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. I apologize for the inconvenience that you are experiencing with our internet service. Can you tell me what type of device you are using to connect to our service? 

Customer:
Yes, I'm using a laptop with Windows 10. 

Agent:
I see. Could you please provide me with some additional information about the laptop, such as the model number and any software that may be installed on it? 

Customer:
Yes, it's an HP Pavilion g6-2210us and I don't think I have any additional software installed. 

Agent:
Thank you for providing that information. Could you please try resetting your router by unplugging it from the wall outlet for 30 seconds and then plugging it back in? This should help to reset your connection and allow for a more stable connection. 

Customer: 
I've already tried that, but it hasn't helped. The connection still keeps dropping out. 

Agent: 
I apologize that resetting your router did not help to resolve your issue. Could you please provide me with more information about the issue, such as when it started happening and if there is anything else you have noticed while experiencing this issue? 

Customer: 
It started happening about a week ago and I haven't noticed anything else out of the ordinary. It just keeps dropping out every few minutes and then reconnects after a few minutes. 

Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this must be for you and I apologize for the inconvenience this is causing. We have had some reports of similar issues in your area recently and our technicians are currently working to resolve them as quickly as possible. In the meantime, we recommend that you try connecting to our network using a different device or another router to see if this helps improve your connection speed or stability.
