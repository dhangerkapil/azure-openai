Customer: Hi there, I'm looking for some help with the phone I purchased from Contoso Wireless.

Agent: Hi there, I'm happy to help you. What seems to be the issue with your phone?

Customer: Well, I've been having some problems with the battery life. It's not lasting as long as it should be. 

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what kind of phone it is and how long have you had it?

Customer: Yes, it's a Contoso Wireless model 5S and I've had it for about three months now.

Agent: Alright, let me take a look into this for you. Could you please tell me more about the battery life issues you're experiencing?

Customer: Sure. It's been getting worse and worse over the past few weeks. It only lasts about 4 hours now before needing to be recharged. 

Agent: Okay, that doesn't sound right. I'll check to see if there's anything we can do to improve your battery life. Could you please provide me with your serial number so that I can look up your phone in our system? 

Customer: Of course! Here's the serial number - XXXXXXX 

Agent: Perfect, thank you. I'll get to work on this right away and see what we can do to help improve your battery life. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: No, that's all for now, thank you! 

Agent: You're welcome! I'll be sure to update you as soon as I find out more information about your phone. Thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless - have a great day!
