Hello, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm having some trouble with my payment. I purchased a new phone from your company, but it seems to be malfunctioning. Can you help me out?

Contoso Wireless Agent: 

Good afternoon, I apologize for any inconvenience you have experienced. We take pride in our products and customer service, so let's see what we can do. Can you tell me more about the problem? 

Customer: 

Yes, of course. The phone I bought is not working correctly. I've already tried to troubleshoot it myself but nothing has worked. Is there any way you can help? 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 

We understand that this can be frustrating, so we will do our best to help you out. Can you please tell me more about the issue? What exactly is not working correctly? 

Customer: 

Well, the phone won't turn on at all. I've tried plugging it into the charger and nothing happens. It's been like this since I purchased it and I'm really disappointed in the product. 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 

I apologize for any disappointment this has caused you. We take pride in our products and we want to make sure that all of our customers are satisfied with their purchase. Can you tell me when and where you purchased the phone? 

Customer: 

I bought it from your online store two weeks ago. But like I said, it's been malfunctioning since then and nothing has worked. Is there anything else I can do? 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 

We appreciate your patience in this situation. Let's try to figure out a solution together. First, can you confirm that the phone is still within its warranty period? 

Customer: 
Yes, the phone is still within its warranty period. What else can I do? 

Contoso Wireless Agent: 
We can try to repair or replace the phone for you if it is still within the warranty period. However, before we can do that we need to verify your payment information to make sure that everything is up to date and accurate. Can you please provide me with your payment information so we can proceed?
