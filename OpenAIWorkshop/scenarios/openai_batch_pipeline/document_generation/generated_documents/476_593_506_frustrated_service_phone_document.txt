"Hello, I am a customer of Contoso Wireless and I am extremely frustrated. I recently purchased a phone from your company and I'm having some issues with it. Can you help me?"

Agent:
"Hello, my name is [Name], and I'm one of the customer service agents at Contoso Wireless. I understand that you are having some issues with your phone. Can you tell me what kind of phone it is and what kind of problems you're experiencing?" 

Customer: 
"I purchased an iPhone 11 Pro Max about two weeks ago, and now it won't turn on. Is there something wrong with the phone?"

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. We take our customers' satisfaction very seriously here at Contoso Wireless. Can you please tell me if the phone was dropped or exposed to any liquid since it was purchased?" 

Customer: 
"No, nothing like that has happened. It just won't turn on."

Agent: 
"Thank you for providing this information. I will do my best to help resolve this issue for you as quickly as possible. Let's start by making sure that the phone is properly charged. Have you tried plugging the phone into a power source?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, I've tried plugging it in several times, but nothing happens." 

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. Let's try another approach. Have you tried performing a hard reset on the phone? This can be done by pressing and holding both the volume down button and the power button for 10 seconds." 

Customer: 
"Yes, I've done that multiple times already and still nothing happens." 

Agent: 
"I understand your frustration. We'll need to try another solution then. Have you tried performing a factory reset on the phone? This will erase all of your data from the device, so make sure to back up anything important before proceeding." 

Customer: 
"Yes, I've done that as well but still no luck." 

 Agent: 
 "I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. It sounds like we may need to take further steps in order to resolve this issue. Let's try one last thing before we move forward with a warranty replacement. Have you tried restarting your router or modem?"
