Customer:

Hi, I'm very frustrated. I just received a notice from Contoso Wireless that my service is being downgraded. What other products do you have that might be a better fit for me?

Agent:

I apologize for any frustration you are feeling. We appreciate your loyalty and we want to make sure that we can help you find the best solution for your needs. 

We offer a variety of products and services to meet your needs. Are there any particular features or capabilities that you are looking for?

Customer: 
Yes, I need something with more data usage, faster speeds, and better coverage than what I'm currently getting with my downgraded service.

Agent: 
We understand the importance of having a reliable connection and we have several options available that may suit your needs. Our Unlimited Plan provides unlimited data usage and our Ultra Plan offers fast speeds and superior coverage. Do either of these plans sound like they would work for you? 

Customer: 
Yes, the Ultra Plan sounds like it might be a good fit. How much does it cost per month? 

Agent: 
The Ultra Plan costs $99 per month, plus applicable taxes and fees. It also includes unlimited talk, text, and data usage as well as access to our nationwide network. Does this sound like something that would work for you? 

Customer: 
That sounds great, but is there anything else that I should know about the plan before I make my decision? 

Agent: 
Yes, there are a few other things to keep in mind when considering this plan. First, the plan does not include international calling or roaming services. Additionally, the plan is subject to data throttling after 30GB of usage in a single month. Lastly, the plan has an Early Termination Fee of $150 if you decide to cancel your contract before its completion date. Do you have any other questions about the plan? 

Customer:  Yes, how long is the contract for this plan? 

Agent: The Ultra Plan requires a two-year contract commitment. After two years, you can either renew your contract or choose to switch to another plan without any additional fees or penalties. Does this answer all of your questions? 

Customer: Yes, that's everything I need to know. Thank you for your help!
