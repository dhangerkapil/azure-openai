Hello, I'm calling about the Contoso Wireless phone I purchased. I'm not very pleased with it and I'd like to discuss downgrading my service.

Customer Service Agent:

Good afternoon, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. I understand you would like to downgrade your service. Could you please tell me what is wrong with the phone?

Customer: 
Yes, I've been using it for a few weeks now and I'm not happy with it at all. The battery life is too short and it keeps freezing up on me. Plus, the camera doesn't take very good pictures. It's just not what I expected from a Contoso Wireless phone.

Customer Service Agent: 
I apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with our product. We strive to provide our customers with the best experience possible. Can you tell me more about why you would like to downgrade your service?

Customer: 
Well, I just don't feel like this phone is worth the money I paid for it. The battery life is too short and the camera quality is not good enough for what I need it for. Plus, I'm paying too much for a phone that's not performing as advertised. So, I would like to downgrade my service and switch to a cheaper plan. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand your frustration and we apologize for any disappointment you may have experienced with your Contoso Wireless phone. We do offer several other plans that may be more suitable for your needs and budget. Would you like me to provide you with more information on these plans? 

Customer: 
Yes, that would be great. I'd like to know more about what other plans are available and how much they cost. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Absolutely! We have several plans available ranging from basic to premium services, all at different prices points to fit different budgets. Our basic plan starts at $19.99/month and includes unlimited text messages, 500 minutes of talk time and 2GB of data usage per month. Our premium plan starts at $39.99/month and includes unlimited text messages, unlimited talk time and 5GB of data usage per month. Would either of these plans work better for you than your current plan? 

Customer: 
Yes, the basic plan sounds like it would be better suited for my needs and budget than my current plan. Can I switch to this plan now? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Of course! We can get you switched over to the basic plan right away! All we need to do is process your payment information and then you will be all set! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: 
No, that's all for now thank you very much for your help!
