Hi, I'm having an issue with streaming on my Contoso Wireless phone. I've tried to troubleshoot it myself, but nothing seems to work. Can you help me?

Agent: 

Hello, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble streaming on your Contoso Wireless phone. Can you please tell me what the issue is so I can help you better?

Customer: 

I can't seem to connect to any streaming services. I've tried connecting to YouTube and Netflix but it just won't work. It keeps saying that there's an error and that it can't connect.

Agent: 

I apologize for the inconvenience. Have you tried rebooting your device or resetting your network connection? That might help resolve the issue.

Customer: 

Yes, I've already tried that but it still doesn't work. Is there anything else I can do? 

Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Let me take a look at your account and see if there are any upgrade services available that might help with the streaming issue. 

Customer: 
What kind of upgrade services do you offer? I'm not really interested in getting a new phone, I just want to be able to stream without any issues. 

Agent: 
We offer a variety of upgrade services, including data plans and device protection plans that can help optimize your streaming experience. We also have a number of options for adding additional data or upgrading your current plan if needed. 

Customer: 
Do any of these options come with a discount or special offer? I'm not interested in spending too much money on this issue. 

Agent: 
Yes, we do have some promotional offers available for our upgrade services. Please let me know which type of upgrade service you are interested in and I can provide more details about the promotional offers available for each option.
