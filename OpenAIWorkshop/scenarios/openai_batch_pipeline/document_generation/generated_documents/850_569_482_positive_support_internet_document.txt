Welcome to Contoso Wireless! How can I help you today?

Customer:

Hi there, I'm having some trouble with the internet connection on my phone. Is there anything you can do to help?

Customer Service Agent:

Absolutely! I'm happy to help. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue? 

Customer: 
Yes, my internet connection is extremely slow. It's been like this for a few days now and it's really starting to get annoying. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me see if I can help you with this. Can you tell me what type of phone and service plan you are using? 

Customer: 
I have an iPhone 7 and I'm on the Gold Plan. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Okay, let me take a look at the settings on your phone and see if there is something that we can do to help improve your connection speed. Can you please open up the Settings app on your phone? 

Customer: 
Sure thing, it's open now. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Great, now go to the Wi-Fi settings and make sure that your Wi-Fi network is turned on and connected. Once that is done, please try using the internet again and let me know if you are still having issues. 

Customer: 
Okay, I've done that and it looks like the connection is a bit faster but it's still not as fast as it should be. Is there anything else I can do? 

 Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, one thing you can try is resetting your network settings. This will erase all of your saved networks and passwords so make sure to have them written down before doing this. To reset your network settings, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. After that is done, please try connecting to your Wi-Fi again and let me know if that helps improve your connection speed. 

 Customer: 
Alright, I've done that and the connection seems to be working better now! Thanks for all of your help!

 Customer Service Agent: 
You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
