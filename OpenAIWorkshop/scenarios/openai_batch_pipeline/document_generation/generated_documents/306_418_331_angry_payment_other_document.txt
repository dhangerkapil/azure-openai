"I'm so angry! I just received my Contoso Wireless bill and it's completely outrageous. I've never been charged this much before! What's going on?"

Agent: 
"I'm sorry to hear that you're upset about your bill. Could you please provide me with more information about what you're seeing?"

Customer: 
"Yes, of course. I'm seeing that I've been charged $120 for a product I don't even have! It says here that it's a Contoso Wireless modem, but I don't have one of those."

Agent: 
"I see. Can you tell me what kind of product you do have?"

Customer: 
"I have a Contoso Wireless router."

Agent: 
"Ok, so it looks like you were charged for the modem, but you only have the router. That does seem like an error. Can you tell me when you purchased the router?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I purchased it about three months ago."

Agent: 
"Ok, thank you for the information. Let me take a look into this and see what's going on. In the meantime, can I help answer any other questions or concerns you may have?"

Customer: 
"Well, since I don't even have the modem, can I get a refund for the amount I was charged?"

Agent: 
"Absolutely! Let me go ahead and process that for you right away. Is there anything else I can help with today?"
