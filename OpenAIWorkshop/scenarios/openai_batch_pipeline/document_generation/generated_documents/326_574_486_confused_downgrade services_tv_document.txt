Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble understanding how the downgrade services for Contoso Wireless works. Could you help me?

Agent: Absolutely! What kind of product are you interested in? 

Customer: Well, I'm thinking of getting a TV, but I'm not sure if the downgrade services apply to that.

Agent: Yes, the downgrade services do apply to TVs. When you purchase a TV with Contoso Wireless, you will receive a free month of service. After that, you can choose to downgrade your service to a lower tier package at any time. 

Customer: So if I decide I don't need all the features in the higher tier package, can I just switch to the lower tier package and save money? 

Agent: Yes, absolutely! If you decide that you don't need the features of the higher tier package, you can downgrade your service at any time and save money. The only difference is that when you downgrade your service, some features may not be available. 

Customer: What kind of features will I lose when I downgrade my service? 

Agent: Depending on which tier package you're currently subscribed to and which one you're downgrading to, some features may not be available. For example, if you're downgrading from the highest tier package to a lower one, some premium channels may no longer be available and your data speeds may be reduced. 

Customer: Okay, so if I understand correctly, I'll still have access to all my current channels and data speeds if I decide to stay with the same tier package? 

Agent: Yes, that's correct. If you stay with the same tier package, you'll still have access to all your current channels and data speeds. However, if you decide to switch to a lower tier package then some features may no longer be available. 

Customer: Alright, that makes sense. Is there anything else I should know about downgrading my service? 

Agent: Yes, when you downgrade your service your monthly bill will be reduced accordingly. Additionally, if you want to upgrade your service back to the original package at any time in the future, you can do so without any additional fees or charges. 

Customer: Great! That's really helpful. Thank you for taking the time to explain this to me.
