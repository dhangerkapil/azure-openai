Customer: Hello, I'm looking for help with a product I purchased from Contoso Wireless. It's a TV.

Agent: Hi, how can I help you with the TV?

Customer: Well, I've had it for about a week and it keeps turning off randomly. Is this normal?

Agent: No, that's not normal. Can you tell me more about what's happening when the TV turns off? 

Customer: Yes, it'll be on and then just shut off completely. The power light will go off and I'll have to turn it back on again. 

Agent: Alright, let's try to troubleshoot this issue together. Can you confirm if the power cord is securely plugged in to the wall and the back of the TV? 

Customer: Yes, it's securely plugged in. 

Agent: Okay great. Can you try unplugging the power cord from both the wall and TV and plugging them back in again? 

Customer: Sure, let me try that now. 

Agent: Great, let me know if that solves the issue or if you're still having trouble with the TV turning off randomly. 

Customer: Alright, I tried unplugging and plugging them back in again but it still keeps happening. 

Agent: Okay, no problem. We can look into this further by trying to reset your TV. Can you confirm what type of TV you have? 

Customer: It's a Contoso Smart 4K Ultra HDTV with HDR 65 inch model. 

Agent: Alright, perfect. To reset your TV please press and hold down the power button for 10 seconds then release it and wait for 30 seconds before turning your TV back on again. Let me know if that helps or not. 

Customer: Ok, I'll give it a try now and let you know what happens.
