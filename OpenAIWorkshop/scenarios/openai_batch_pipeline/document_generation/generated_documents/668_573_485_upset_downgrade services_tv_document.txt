Customer: I'm very upset. I just found out that I'm being downgraded from my current product to a lower quality service and I don't understand why. I just bought a new TV from your company, and now it's not going to work as well as I was promised. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue? 

Customer: Well, when I purchased the TV, it said that it was compatible with Contoso Wireless's premium service. But now they're telling me that it won't be able to access all the features and services with the downgrade. This is really disappointing. 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, I understand how frustrating this must be. We do apologize for any confusion regarding our products. Can you tell me which TV model you purchased? 

Customer: Yes, it's the Contoso Ultra HD 4K Smart TV. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let me look into this for you and see what I can find out about why you're being downgraded from the premium service. Please give me just a few moments while I research this further. 

[A few moments pass]

Customer Service Agent: Alright, thank you for your patience. It appears that the Contoso Ultra HD 4K Smart TV is not compatible with our premium service due to some technical limitations with the product itself. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused when you initially purchased the product. 

Customer: So even though the website said that it was compatible with the premium service, it actually isn't? That's so misleading! Is there anything you can do to help me out? 

Customer Service Agent: Unfortunately, since we are unable to offer the full range of features with this particular model of TV, there isn't much we can do in terms of providing a solution. However, as a gesture of goodwill we would like to offer you a discount on your next purchase with us as an apology for any inconvenience this has caused you. Would that be something of interest? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great. Thank you so much for your help and understanding in this matter!
