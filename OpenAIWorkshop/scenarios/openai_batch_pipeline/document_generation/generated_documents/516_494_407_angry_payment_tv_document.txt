Customer Service Agent:

Good morning, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. How may I help you today? 

Customer:

Yes, I need to speak to someone about my payment. I just got a bill for a new TV and it's way too expensive. 

Customer Service Agent:

I'm sorry to hear that, let me see what I can do to help. Can you provide me with your account number? 

Customer: 
Yes, here it is [account number]. I bought this TV from your store and the price is way too high. I want a refund! 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand your frustration, but we cannot issue refunds for products that have already been purchased. Can you tell me why you think the price is too high? 

Customer: 
Well, I checked online and the same TV is available for much cheaper from other stores. Why is your price so much higher? It's not fair! 

Customer Service Agent: 
I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We strive to offer competitive prices on all of our products. However, some of our prices may be slightly higher due to the fact that we offer additional benefits such as free delivery, extended warranties and customer service support. Is there anything else I can do to help you today? 

Customer: 
Yes, I'd like to know what kind of payment options you have available for this TV. I'm not sure if I can afford it at this price. 

Customer Service Agent: 
We accept all major credit cards as well as PayPal and Apple Pay. We also offer financing options with low monthly payments and no interest if paid in full within 12 months. Would you like more information on these payment options? 

 Customer: 
Yes, please provide me with more information about the financing options so that I can decide if they are right for me.
