Customer: 
I recently purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and I'm not satisfied with it. I need to know what my options are.

Agent: 
Hello, I'm sorry to hear that you're not satisfied with your phone. Could you tell me a bit more about what's been going on?

Customer: 
The phone keeps freezing up and the battery life is terrible. I'm not sure what else to do but return it.

Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Before we move forward with a return, let me check if there's anything else we can do to help resolve the issue. Can you provide me with the model number of your phone?

Customer: 
It's a Contoso Wireless Model 987. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing that information. Please give me one moment while I check on this issue for you. 

(A few moments pass) 

Agent: 
Based on the model number, it looks like there have been some reported issues with the software on your device. I recommend that you try performing a factory reset to see if that resolves the issue. Would you like me to walk you through the steps? 

Customer: 
Yes, please do. I'm not sure how to do it. 

Agent: 
No problem! Here are the steps to perform a factory reset on your device: 

1) On your device, open the Settings app and tap Backup & Reset; 

2) Tap Factory Data Reset; 

3) Tap Reset Device; and then

4) Tap Erase Everything.  

Once complete, your device should be restored to its original settings and any performance issues should be resolved. Does this sound like something you would like to try?  

Customer: 
Yes, that sounds good. I'll try it and let you know if it works or not. Thank you for your help!
