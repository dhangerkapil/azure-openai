Customer: "Hi, I'm having an issue with my Contoso Wireless account. I'm trying to set up a new tv and I can't seem to get it to work properly. Can you help me?"

Agent: "Hello! Of course, we'd be happy to help you with that. Can you tell me a little bit more about the problem you're having?"

Customer: "I'm trying to connect my tv to the internet and it won't work. I've followed all the instructions but it still won't connect."

Agent: "I see. Let's see what we can do. Is this a new tv or an existing one that you are connecting?"

Customer: "It's a new one. I just bought it today and I want to get it set up."

Agent: "Ok, let's take a look. Is your Contoso Wireless account active and up-to-date? Are you able to access the internet on other devices?" 

Customer: "Yes, my account is active and I can access the internet on my laptop and phone." 

Agent: "That's great. It sounds like the issue might be related to your tv's settings. Can you tell me what model of tv you have?" 

Customer: "It's a Samsung QLED 55 inch model." 

Agent: "Ok, let's take a look at the settings for that model. Can you please go into your tv's settings menu and check if there is an option for 'wireless connection' or 'network connection'? 

Customer: "Yes, I see that option. It says 'network connection'." 

Agent: "Great! Go ahead and select that option and enter in your Contoso Wireless network name and password when prompted. That should connect your tv to the internet." 

Customer: "Ok, I did that but it still isn't working." 

Agent: "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you try resetting the tv and then trying again? If that doesn't work, please call our technical support line so they can help troubleshoot the issue further."
