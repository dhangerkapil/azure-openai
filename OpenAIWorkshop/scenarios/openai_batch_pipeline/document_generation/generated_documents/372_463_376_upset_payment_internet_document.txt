"I'm having trouble with my internet service. I've been trying to pay my bill but I'm not sure what the problem is."

Customer Service Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please provide me with your account number so I can look into this for you?"

Customer: 
"Sure, it's 123456."

Customer Service Agent: 
"Thanks for providing me with your account number. It looks like there is a past due balance on your account that needs to be paid before service can be restored. Is there a particular payment method you would like to use?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I'd like to pay with a credit card."

Customer Service Agent: 
"No problem. I can process that payment right now if you'd like. What type of credit card are you using?"

Customer: 
"I'm using a Visa."

Customer Service Agent: 
"Great, I just need some information from you. What is the name on the card?"

Customer: 
"John Smith." 

Customer Service Agent: 
"And what is the card number?" 

Customer: 
"It's 4111111111111111." 

Customer Service Agent: 
"Thanks for providing that information. Is this a one-time payment or would you like to set up an automatic monthly payment plan?" 

Customer: 
"I'd like to set up an automatic monthly payment plan so I don't have to worry about it every month." 
  
Customer Service Agent: 

"No problem. I can set that up right now. Can you confirm that you want the payment to be deducted from this credit card each month?"
