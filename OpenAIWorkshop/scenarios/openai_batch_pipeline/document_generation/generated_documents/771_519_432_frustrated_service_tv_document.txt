Customer: I am so frustrated! I've been trying to get this Contoso Wireless TV service set up for days now and nothing seems to be working!

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me a bit more about what's going on?

Customer: Well, I followed all the instructions but the TV won't connect. I've tried resetting it and connecting it to different outlets but nothing works.

Agent: Ok, let's see if we can figure out what's wrong. What model of TV are you using?

Customer: It's a Samsung 55 inch 4K Ultra HDTV.

Agent: Alright, let's take a look at the connection settings on your TV. Is it connected to your home network? 

Customer: Yes, I've double-checked that multiple times and it is connected. 

Agent: Are you using an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi to connect? 

Customer: Wi-Fi. 

Agent: Okay, let's check the signal strength of your Wi-Fi network. Is it at least 50% or higher? 

Customer: Yes, it's at least 80%. 

Agent: Great. Can you try restarting your router and then reconnecting the TV to the network? 

Customer: I already tried that but it still won't connect. 

Agent: Alright, let's try one more thing before we move on to other options. Is your router compatible with Contoso Wireless TV service? 

Customer: Yes, it is compatible. 

Agent: Ok, great. In that case, we can move on to other troubleshooting steps. Can you confirm which version of the Contoso Wireless app you have installed on your TV? 

Customer: I believe it is the latest version. 

Agent: Ok, that should work. Let's try resetting the app and then reconnecting to the network again. Can you do that for me? 

 Customer: Sure, I can give that a try.
