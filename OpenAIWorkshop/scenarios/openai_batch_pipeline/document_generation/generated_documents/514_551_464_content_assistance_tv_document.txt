Customer: Hi, I'm looking for some help with my Contoso Wireless product. I recently purchased a new TV and need to set it up with my wireless connection.

Agent: Hi there! Thanks for reaching out to Contoso Wireless! I'll be happy to assist you with setting up your TV. Could you please provide me with the model number of your TV?

Customer: Yes, it's the CX-12345.

Agent: Perfect, thank you for that information. Before we begin, do you have an active Contoso Wireless account?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Agent: Great! Let's get started. First, we'll need to connect the TV to your Contoso Wireless router. Please make sure that the TV is powered on and within range of the router. Then, on your TV, open the Settings menu and select Network or Wi-Fi. Select the Contoso Wireless network from the list of available networks and enter your Contoso Wireless username and password when prompted. Once you've entered the correct credentials, select Connect or Join and wait for the connection to be established.

Customer: Ok, I think I've got it now. The TV is connected to the router and it says that I'm connected to Contoso Wireless. What do I do next?

Agent: Now that you're connected to Contoso Wireless, you can access our streaming services or browse the internet on your TV. You may need to update any apps or software on your TV before they can be used. To update these apps, open the app store on your TV and search for any available updates. 

Customer: Got it! Is there anything else I should know about using my new TV? 

Agent: Yes! To get the most out of your Contoso Wireless service, make sure to use a 5GHz connection whenever possible for faster speeds and more reliable connections. Also, if you ever have any questions or issues with your Contoso Wireless service, please don't hesitate to reach out to us for assistance! 

Customer: Alright, thanks for all of this help! I really appreciate it. 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
