Customer: Hi, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm having an issue with my payment.

Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your payment. How can I help?

Customer: I recently subscribed to your product streaming service but the payment didn't go through. Can you tell me what happened?

Agent: Absolutely! Let me take a look into this for you. Could you please provide me with the payment details that you used when subscribing?

Customer: Sure. It was a Visa card ending in 1234, and the name on the card is John Smith. 

Agent: Thanks for providing the information, John. Let me take a look and see what happened. It should only take a few minutes. 

Customer: Okay, thank you.
