Customer: Hi, I'm calling about my Contoso Wireless bill. I'm not sure why I was charged for the TV product. Can you help me understand?

Agent: Hello, and thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. I'll be more than happy to help you understand why you were charged for the TV product. Can you tell me more about the issue?

Customer: Sure. I was expecting to pay a certain amount for my bill each month, but when I got my latest bill, it was higher than expected. When I looked into it, I noticed that it included a charge for the TV product. Can you explain why?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. The TV product is an optional add-on that allows you to access additional channels and content on your Contoso Wireless device. It's billed separately from your monthly service plan and is added to your bill once you've subscribed to it. Is this something that you signed up for?

Customer: No, I didn't sign up for it. Is there a way to get the charge removed from my bill?

Agent: Yes, of course! Since you didn't sign up for the TV product, we can remove the charge from your bill. To do this, we'll need to cancel your subscription to the product and then refund the charge back to your account. Is this something that you'd like me to do for you?

Customer: Yes, please! That would be great! 

Agent: No problem! I've gone ahead and canceled your subscription to the TV product and refunded the charge back to your account. You should see this reflected in your next billing statement. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks so much for your help! 

Agent: You're very welcome! Have a great day!
