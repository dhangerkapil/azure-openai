Customer: Hi, I'm having some trouble with my internet. Can you help?

Agent: Hi there! I'm so sorry to hear that. Let me see if I can help you out. What kind of issue are you having?

Customer: Well, I'm not sure what's going on. My internet has been going in and out for a couple of days now and it's getting pretty frustrating.

Agent: Okay, let me take a look at your account and see if I can figure out what's causing the issue. Could you tell me your account number?

Customer: Sure, it's [account number]. 

Agent: Thanks, I have your account pulled up now. It looks like your current plan is the Contoso Wireless Basic Internet plan which gives you a download speed of up to 10 Mbps. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that sounds right. 

Agent: Okay, so it looks like the issue may be related to your billing. It looks like your last payment was two months ago, and it appears that you're overdue for another payment. Is this something you were aware of? 

Customer: Oh no! I had no idea! How much do I owe? 

Agent: It looks like you owe $99.99 for the past two months. 

Customer: Alright, that's not too bad. How can I go about making the payment? 

Agent: You can make a payment online by logging into your account on our website or you can call our customer service line and make a payment over the phone. 

Customer: That's great, thank you so much for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, I think that should do it for now. Thank you again! 

Agent: You're very welcome! Have a great day!
