Customer: 

Hello, I'm having some issues with my account and internet service with Contoso Wireless. I've had it for a few months now, but the connection has been spotty and unreliable. Can you help me out?

Agent:

Hello there! I apologize for the inconvenience you're experiencing with your account and internet service. We understand how frustrating this can be, and we are here to help you out. Could you please provide me with some more details about the issue you are having?

Customer: 

Well, I'm not getting the speeds that were promised when I signed up for the plan. It's really slow and often times it won't even connect at all.

Agent: 

I apologize for the slow speeds and connection issues that you are experiencing. We would like to take a closer look at your account to better understand what is going on. Could you please provide me with your account information so that we can take a look? 

Customer: 

Sure, my account number is XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX. 

Agent: 
Alright, thank you for providing me with your account information. Let me take a closer look at your account and see what I can do to help resolve this issue. Please give me one moment while I investigate further.

Agent: 
I've taken a closer look at your account and it appears that the internet speed you are receiving is slower than what was promised when you signed up for the plan. It looks like there is an issue on our end that needs to be addressed. In order to get this resolved, we will need to send a technician out to your home to assess the issue and make sure that everything is working properly. We can have someone out there within 24-48 hours if that works for you. 

Customer: 
Yes, that should be fine. Is there anything else I need to do in the meantime? 

 Agent: 
No, not at this time. We will have someone out there within 24-48 hours and they will be able to resolve the issue and get your internet speed back up to where it should be. In the meantime, if you experience any further issues please do not hesitate to reach out to us again so that we can assist further.
