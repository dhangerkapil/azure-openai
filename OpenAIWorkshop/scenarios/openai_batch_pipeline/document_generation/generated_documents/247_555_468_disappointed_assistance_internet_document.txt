Hello, I am a customer of Contoso Wireless and I am having some trouble with your product. I bought an internet package from you and it is not working. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent:

Hello there, thank you for reaching out to us. We apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please explain the issue in more detail so that we can better assist you?

Customer: 
Yes, I purchased an internet package a few days ago and it still isn't working. It was supposed to be up and running by now, but I haven't been able to get online yet. Can you help me out? 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand your frustration, and we apologize for the delay in getting your service set up. We'll do our best to get this resolved as quickly as possible. Could you please tell me if you have already tried restarting your device or resetting your router? 

Customer: 
Yes, I've tried both of those things and it still isn't working. I'm really disappointed because I need the internet to work as soon as possible. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand, and we apologize for the delay in getting your service up and running. We'll do our best to get this resolved quickly. Could you please provide us with some more information about your device, such as the model number and operating system? 

Customer: 
Yes, my device is a Dell Inspiron 15 laptop with Windows 10 operating system. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Thank you for providing that information. We'll investigate the issue further to determine what is causing the delay in getting your service up and running. In the meantime, would you like us to provide you with a temporary solution such as a free trial of our mobile hotspot plan? 

Customer: 
That would be great! I really appreciate it if you can help me out with that. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Of course! We will set up a free trial of our mobile hotspot plan right away so that you can stay connected while we investigate the issue with your internet package. Please let us know if there is anything else we can do to help.
