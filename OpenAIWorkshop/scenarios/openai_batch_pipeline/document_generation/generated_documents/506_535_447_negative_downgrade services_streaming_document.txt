Customer: 
"Hi, I recently got a streaming product from Contoso Wireless and I'm very unhappy with the service. The streaming quality is terrible and I want to downgrade my subscription. Can you help me out?"

Agent: 
"Hello, thank you for reaching out to Contoso Wireless! I apologize for any trouble you're having with our streaming service. We would be happy to help you downgrade your subscription. Can you tell me more about the issue you are having?"

Customer: 
"The streaming quality is just not good enough. It's really slow and the video is often lagging or buffering. It's really frustrating and I want to downgrade my subscription."

Agent: 
"I understand how that can be very frustrating. Unfortunately, there is no way for us to improve the streaming quality of your current subscription without upgrading it. However, we can certainly help you downgrade your subscription if that's what you'd like to do."

Customer: 
"Yes, that's what I'd like to do. How can I go about downgrading my subscription?"

Agent: 
"Downgrading your subscription is easy! All you need to do is log into your account and select the 'Downgrade' option from the menu. Once you have selected this option, you will be able to select a lower tier of service that meets your needs."

Customer: 
"Okay, great. Is there anything else I should know about downgrading my subscription? Will I have to pay any additional fees or penalties?"

Agent: 
"No, there will be no additional fees or penalties associated with downgrading your subscription. The only thing that may change is the quality of service that you receive as some features may not be available with a lower tier of service." 

Customer: 
"Alright, that sounds good. So, if I downgrade my subscription now, when will the new service take effect?" 

Agent: 
"Downgrading your subscription will take effect immediately once it has been processed. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out again."
