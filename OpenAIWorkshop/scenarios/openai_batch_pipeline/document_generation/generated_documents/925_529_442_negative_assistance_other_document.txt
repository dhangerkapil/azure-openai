Hello, I'm looking for assistance with a product from Contoso Wireless. I recently purchased a new phone and I'm having trouble setting it up. Could you help me out?

Agent: 

Good afternoon, thank you for reaching out to Contoso Wireless! We'd be happy to help you with your issue. Could you please provide me with some more details about the issue you're experiencing?

Customer: 

Sure. I'm having trouble connecting to the Wi-Fi network. The phone keeps saying that it's unable to connect, even though I've entered in the correct credentials.

Agent: 

I understand. It sounds like you may need to reset your Wi-Fi settings on the phone. To do this, go to your phone's settings, select Wi-Fi, and then select 'forget network.' Once this is done, try reconnecting to the network using the correct credentials. Does this help? 

Customer: 

I tried that but it still isn't working. Is there anything else I can do? 

Agent: 

I apologize that this isn't working as expected. Are you able to connect to any other Wi-Fi networks? If so, it may be an issue with the specific network you're trying to connect to. If not, then it may be an issue with your device itself. Is there anything else we can help you with? 

Customer: 
No, that's all I need for now. I just want my phone to be able to connect to the Wi-Fi network. 

Agent: 
I understand your frustration. Let's take one more step before giving up on this issue. Can you try restarting your phone and then trying again? Sometimes restarting a device can resolve connection issues like this one. 

Customer: 
Alright, I'll give that a try and see if it works. Thanks for your help! 

Agent: 
You're welcome! Please let us know if there's anything else we can do for you. Have a great day!
