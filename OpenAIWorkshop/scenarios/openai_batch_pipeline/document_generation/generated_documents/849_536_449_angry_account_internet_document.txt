Hello, I'm having some issues with my Contoso Wireless internet. Can you help me out?

Agent:
Hello, I apologize for the inconvenience. What seems to be the issue?

Customer:
I can't seem to get my internet to work. I've tried everything and it still isn't working. 

Agent:
I understand how frustrating this can be. Let's see if we can get this sorted out. Can you tell me what type of device you are using? 

Customer:
I'm using a laptop that I just bought from Contoso Wireless. 

Agent:
I see. Are you able to connect to any other networks? 

Customer:
Yes, I'm able to connect to other networks but not the Contoso Wireless network. 

Agent: 
OK, let's try a few things. First, can you please check that your account is active? To do this, go to our website and log into your account. Once you're logged in, check your account status. 

Customer: 
OK, I've done that and it says that my account is active. 

Agent: 
Great! Now, let's try resetting your modem/router. To do this, turn off the modem/router and wait for 30 seconds before turning it back on. Once it's back on, try connecting to the Contoso Wireless network again and let me know if that worked. 

Customer: 
OK, I've done that and it still isn't working. What else can we try? 

Agent: 
Let's try resetting your laptop's network settings. To do this, open the Control Panel and go to Network and Sharing Center. Then click on Change adapter settings and right-click on your wireless connection and select Properties. Under the Networking tab, select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click Properties. Then select Obtain an IP address automatically and Obtain DNS server address automatically and click OK. Try connecting to the Contoso Wireless network again and let me know if that worked.
