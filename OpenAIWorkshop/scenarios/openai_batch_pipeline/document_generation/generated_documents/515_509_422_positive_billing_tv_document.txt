Hello, my name is [Name], and I'm a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today? 

Customer:
Hi [Name], I recently purchased a TV from Contoso Wireless and I have some questions about my bill. Can you help me out? 

Customer Service Agent:
Yes, of course! What would you like to know about your bill? 

Customer:
I noticed that there was a one-time fee of $50 added to my bill. What is this fee for? 

Customer Service Agent:
That fee is the activation fee for your new TV. It's an upfront cost that covers the cost of activating your TV. 

Customer:
Oh, okay. That makes sense. Is there any way to avoid this fee in the future? 

Customer Service Agent:
Yes, absolutely! If you sign up for our Contoso Wireless subscription plan, you can avoid this activation fee in the future. With the subscription plan, you will get unlimited access to all of our products and services for one low monthly price. 

Customer:
That sounds great! Can you tell me more about the subscription plan? 

Customer Service Agent:
Sure! Our subscription plan includes unlimited access to all of our products and services, as well as discounts on select products and services. Additionally, you will get priority customer service and access to exclusive offers and promotions. 

Customer:
That sounds like an amazing deal! Is there anything else I should know before signing up for the subscription plan? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, just be aware that if you decide to cancel your subscription at any time, you will be charged a cancellation fee. However, if you decide to stay with us for at least 6 months, we will waive the cancellation fee. Does that answer all of your questions about billing? 

Customer: 
Yes it does! Thank you so much for your help [Name].
