Hello, I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about Contoso Wireless' product TV?

Agent: 
Sure, what would you like to know?

Customer: 
I'm curious about the payment options. What are the different payment methods?

Agent: 
At Contoso Wireless, we offer several different payment methods to make it convenient for our customers. We accept all major credit cards, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. We also accept PayPal and Apple Pay. Additionally, we offer financing options through our partner companies.

Customer: 
That's great! Are there any discounts or deals for customers who pay in full upfront? 

Agent: 
Yes, absolutely! We offer a 10% discount for customers who pay in full at the time of purchase. Additionally, we sometimes have promotional discounts and offers that can be applied to purchases. Please keep an eye out for those as well. 

Customer: 
That's great to know! Is there any way I can set up recurring payments so I don't have to worry about forgetting to make my payment each month? 

Agent: 
Yes, absolutely! You can set up recurring payments by logging into your account and selecting the "Recurring Payments" option. From there you can select how frequently you'd like to make payments and what type of payment method you'd like to use. You can also set up automatic reminders if you'd like. 

Customer: 
That sounds perfect! Is there any way to get an extended warranty on my product? 

Agent: 
Yes, we do offer extended warranties on all of our products. You can purchase an extended warranty when you make your initial purchase or you can add one at any time afterwards by logging into your account and selecting the "Extended Warranty" option. Our extended warranties cover most repairs and replacements for a period of up to three years from the date of purchase. 

Customer: 
That's great! Can I use multiple payment methods for one purchase? For example, using my credit card for part of the payment and using PayPal for the rest? 

Agent: 
Yes, absolutely! You can use multiple payment methods for one purchase by logging into your account and selecting the "Split Payment" option. From there you'll be able to enter in both payment methods and specify how much you want each one to cover. Once that's done, simply submit your order and it will be processed accordingly.
