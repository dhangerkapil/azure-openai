"I am so angry right now. I just bought a Contoso Wireless TV and it's not working. What kind of customer service is this? I want to know what's going on!"

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience. We take customer satisfaction very seriously at Contoso Wireless and I would be more than happy to help you figure out what's wrong with your TV. Can you tell me more about the issue you're having?"

Customer: 
"It won't turn on. I've checked all the cables and connections, and nothing is working. I'm not very tech-savvy so I'm not sure what else to do."

Agent: 
"I understand. Let's start with the basics. Is the power cable securely plugged into both the TV and an outlet?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, it is." 

Agent: 
"Have you tried pressing the power button on the remote or the TV itself?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, I have tried that too but nothing happens." 

Agent: 
"In that case, it could be a hardware issue. Can you confirm if the TV was purchased from us directly or through a third-party retailer?" 

Customer: 
"I bought it directly from Contoso Wireless." 

Agent: 
"Ok great. Since you purchased it directly from us, we can arrange for a technician to come out and take a look at your TV. Would that work for you?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, that would be great! How soon can someone come out?" 

 Agent: 
"We can have someone out in two business days. Would that work for you?" 

 Customer: 
"Yes, that would be perfect. Thank you for your help!"
