Hello, I'm not happy with the streaming service that Contoso Wireless offers. I've had trouble connecting to my device and the video keeps buffering. Can you help me?

Agent:

Good day! Thank you for reaching out to us. I understand your concern and would be more than happy to help. Can you please provide some more details about the issue you are facing with streaming? 

Customer:

Sure, I'm having trouble connecting my device to the Contoso Wireless streaming service. Every time I try to connect, it takes forever and eventually times out. The video also keeps buffering even when I have a strong connection. 

Agent: 

I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Could you please confirm if the connection is dropping or if it is slow? 

Customer: 
Yes, the connection is dropping and it's really slow as well. It's been like this for a few days now. 

Agent: 
I apologize for the inconvenience. Please allow me to look into this further for you. Could you please provide your account details so I can take a closer look at your account? 

Customer: 
Sure, my account number is 123456 and my name is John Smith. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing the information. I'll be glad to look into this further for you. In the meantime, can you please try restarting your device and router, and then try connecting again? This should help in improving your streaming experience. 

Customer: 
Yes, I've already tried that but it didn't seem to help. Is there anything else I can do? 

Agent: 
I understand that restarting your device and router did not work out for you. Let me investigate further into this matter so that we can resolve it as soon as possible. In the meantime, can you please provide us with any error messages that may appear on the screen when you try to connect? This will help us in understanding the issue better.
