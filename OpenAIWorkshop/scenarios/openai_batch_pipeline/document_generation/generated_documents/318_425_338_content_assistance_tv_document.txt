Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless TV and I am having trouble setting it up. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi there! We're glad to hear that you've chosen Contoso Wireless for your TV needs. Of course, we can help you set up your new TV. Can you tell me what kind of difficulty you are having?

Customer: Yes, I'm having trouble connecting it to the internet. I have the correct password but it's not connecting.

Agent: Not to worry, we can help you with that. First off, let's make sure that your internet connection is set up correctly. Have you double-checked your settings to make sure they are correct? 

Customer: Yes, I have double-checked the settings and they seem to be correct. 

Agent: Alright, let's try some other troubleshooting steps then. Have you tried restarting both your router and your TV? That can often help resolve internet connection issues. 

Customer: Yes, I have already tried restarting both the router and the TV. 

Agent: In that case, we can try resetting the network settings on your TV. To do this, go to the Settings menu on your TV and select Network > Reset Network Settings. Then try connecting again with the correct password. 

Customer: Ok, I will give that a try and see if it works. 

Agent: Perfect! Let me know if you have any further issues or questions while setting up your TV. We are here to help! 

Customer: Thanks for all your help!
