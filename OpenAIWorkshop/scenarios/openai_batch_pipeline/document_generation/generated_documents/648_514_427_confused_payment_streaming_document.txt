Hello, I'm having some trouble understanding the payment process for Contoso Wireless. Can you help me out?

Agent:
Hi there! Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you understand our payment process. What questions do you have about it? 

Customer:
Well, I'm interested in signing up for your streaming service, but I'm not sure how much it costs. Can you explain that to me?

Agent:
Sure! Our streaming service is a monthly subscription that costs $9.99 per month. You can cancel anytime if you decide it's not for you. Does that answer your question? 

Customer:
Yes, that does answer my question. But what about taxes and other fees? Is there anything else I need to pay on top of the $9.99? 

Agent: 
Yes, there are taxes and other fees that may apply depending on where you live. These fees will be calculated at checkout when you sign up for the service. Does that make sense? 

Customer: 
Yes, it does make sense. But how do I know when my payment will be due each month? Do I have to pay at the same time every month? 

Agent: 
No, you don't have to pay at the same time every month. When you sign up for the service, you will be asked to provide a payment method and then each month your payment will be automatically charged on the date of your original sign up. Does that help clarify things? 

Customer: 
Yes, that does help clarify things. One last question - do I have to sign a contract or any other legal documents in order to use your streaming service? 

Agent: 
No, there is no contract or legal documents required to use our streaming service. Once you sign up and make your first payment, you are free to use the service as long as your subscription is active and your payments are up to date. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
