Agent: Absolutely! I'd be happy to assist you. Can you tell me more about what you're looking for help with? 

Customer: Well, I'm trying to figure out how much I need to pay for the internet service that Contoso Wireless offers. Do I have to pay a one-time fee or do I need to make monthly payments? 

Agent: Great question. We offer both options for our internet service. If you choose the one-time fee option, then you'll need to pay the full amount upfront. This option is best for customers who plan on using our internet service for a short period of time. If you choose the monthly payment option, then you'll pay a set amount each month. This is a great option if you plan on using our service for an extended period of time. 

Customer: That's helpful, thank you. So, how much would the one-time fee be and how much would I have to pay each month? 

Agent: The one-time fee varies depending on the type of service that you select. For example, our basic internet package is $50 for the one-time fee and $30 per month. Our premium internet package is $100 for the one-time fee and $60 per month. 

Customer: Alright, so if I choose the basic package it would cost me $50 upfront and then $30 each month after that? 

Agent: That's correct. You can also upgrade your package at any time if you find that you need more speed or data usage than what's offered in the basic package. 

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. What other services do you offer? 

Agent: We offer a variety of services including phone plans, TV packages, and other add-on features such as extra data usage or faster speeds. You can view all of our available services and packages on our website or by speaking with one of our customer service representatives directly. 

Customer: That sounds great. Is there anything else I should know about the payment process? 

Agent: Yes! It's important to note that all payments are due on the same day of each month regardless of which payment option you choose. We also offer autopay options if you want to set up automatic payments from your bank account or credit card each month. 

Customer: Got it, thanks for all the information! That should do it for now. 

Agent: No problem at all! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
