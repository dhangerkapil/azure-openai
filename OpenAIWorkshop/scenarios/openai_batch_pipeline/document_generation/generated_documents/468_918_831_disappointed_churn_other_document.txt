Customer: I am extremely disappointed with the service that Contoso Wireless provides. I have been a customer for a few months now, and I feel like the service has been terrible. I am thinking about churning.

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for your dissatisfaction with our services. Can you tell me more about what is making you feel this way?

Customer: Well, first off, the coverage is spotty at best and I’m constantly dropping calls or having difficulty getting connected. On top of that, the customer service has been terrible. It takes forever to get someone on the phone and when I do, they don’t seem to know anything about my account or what I’m talking about.

Customer Service Agent: That certainly does sound frustrating! We do value our customers and want to make sure that they are satisfied with our services. What can we do to try to make things better for you? 

Customer: Well, first of all, I need better coverage. Secondly, your customer service needs to be more knowledgeable and efficient. Thirdly, I’d like to know what other products you offer that may be better than what I have now. 

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely. Let me start by addressing your coverage concerns. We have several options available that may be able to provide a stronger signal in your area. Do you think that might be something that would help? 

Customer: Yes, it definitely would help if my signal was stronger. 

Customer Service Agent: Great! Let me go ahead and get some information from you so we can look into which options are available in your area. Can you tell me your zip code? 

Customer: Sure, my zip code is 12345. 

Customer Service Agent: Thanks! Now let me check on our other products that may be able to provide better service than what you currently have. We offer several different plans with different features and benefits that may fit your needs better than what you currently have. Are there any particular features or benefits that you are looking for in a plan? 

Customer: Yes, I would like something with more data so that I can stream movies and music without worrying about running out of data every month. 

Customer Service Agent: Got it! We have several plans with different amounts of data available so let me take a look at what we have available for you in your area. One moment please... Alright, it looks like we have three plans available for you in your area that offer different amounts of data ranging from 10GB to 30GB per month. Would one of those work for you? 

Customer: Yes, those sound great! Can you tell me a bit more about them? What are the differences between them? 

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! The 10GB plan offers 10GB of data per month and comes with unlimited talk and text as well as free access to our streaming services such as ContosoTV and ContosoMusic. The 20GB plan offers 20GB of data per month plus all the features included in the 10GB plan as well as access to our premium streaming services such as ContosoPremiumTV and ContosoPremiumMusic. Lastly, the 30GB plan offers 30GB of data per month plus all the features included in the 10GB and 20GB plans as well as access to our highest tier streaming services such as ContosoUltraTV and ContosoUltraMusic.  Does one of those sound like something that would work for you? 

Customer: Yes, the 30GB plan sounds perfect! Can you tell me how much it costs? 

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! The 30GB plan costs $80 per month plus taxes and fees. Would you like to sign up for it today or do you need some time to think about it? 

 Customer: No, I think I'm ready to sign up now!
