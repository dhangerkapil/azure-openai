Customer:
"I recently purchased internet service from Contoso Wireless and I am having a lot of trouble with the connection. It keeps going in and out and I can't get any work done. Can you help me out?"

Agent:
"I apologize for the inconvenience that you have experienced. We at Contoso Wireless strive to provide the best service possible, so I would be happy to help you. Could you tell me more about the issue that you are having?" 

Customer:
"Well, like I said, my internet connection keeps going in and out. It's incredibly frustrating because I can't get any work done." 

Agent:
"I understand how inconvenient this can be. Do you mind if I ask if you've tried rebooting your modem or router?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, I've tried that multiple times but it hasn't helped. Is there anything else I can do?" 

Agent: 
"Yes, we suggest running an internet speed test to ensure that your connection is running at its optimal speed. This will help us determine whether or not there is a connection issue." 

Customer: 
"Ok, I'll try that now. What do I need to do exactly?" 

Agent: 
"Go to a website such as www.speedtest.net and run the speed test. Once the test is completed, send us a screenshot of the results along with your account information so that we can take a closer look at your issue." 

Customer: 
"Ok, I'll do that now. How long do you think it will take for you to resolve this issue?" 

Agent: 
"Once we receive the screenshot of your results, we should be able to investigate further and provide you with an update within 24-48 hours."
