Customer Service Agent: Hi there, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. How can I help you?

Customer: I'm having a lot of trouble with my account. I've been trying to get my product streaming and it's not working.

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me what the issue is?

Customer: Yes, I can't seem to get the product streaming on my account. Every time I try to access it, it just won't load.

Customer Service Agent: Have you tried restarting your device?

Customer: Yes, I have done that several times but it still won't work. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, let's take a look at your account and see if we can find the problem. Could you please provide me with your account number? 

Customer: Sure, here it is [account number provided]. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you. Let me just pull up your account and see what's going on. It looks like there was a problem with the payment information associated with your account. Can you confirm that this is up to date? 

Customer: Yes, I have double checked and everything is correct. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let me run a few tests on the product streaming service and see if that helps. In the meantime, can you tell me what type of device you are using? 

Customer: Yes, I am using an iPhone 8 Plus. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, that should be compatible with our product streaming service. Let me just run a few tests and see if we can get it working for you. 

Customer: Okay, thank you for looking into this for me. 

Customer Service Agent: Of course! Please give me just a few moments while I run these tests and troubleshoot the issue. 

[A few moments pass] 

 Customer Service Agent: Alright, it looks like the issue has been resolved! Can you try accessing the product streaming now and let me know if it works? 

 Customer: Yes, I will give it a try now! 

 Customer Service Agent: Great! Please let me know if there are any other issues that arise or if there is anything else I can do for you today!
