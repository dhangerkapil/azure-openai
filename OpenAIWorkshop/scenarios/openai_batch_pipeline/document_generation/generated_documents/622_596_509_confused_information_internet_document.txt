Customer: Hi, I was wondering if you could tell me some information about your internet product?

Customer: Okay, great. What about contracts? Do I have to sign one?

Customer Service Agent: No, we do not require customers to sign a contract. All of our plans are month-to-month, so you can cancel at any time with no penalty. 

Customer: That's good to know. What about installation fees? 

Customer Service Agent: Installation fees vary depending on the plan you select and your location. Generally speaking, the installation fee for our 5 Mbps plan is around $99 and for our 100 Mbps plan it is around $149. 

Customer: Alright, so how long does it take for the service to be installed once I sign up? 

Customer Service Agent: Generally speaking, it takes between 7-10 business days for the service to be installed after you sign up. However, this can vary depending on your location and availability of our technicians in your area. 

Customer: Okay, that sounds reasonable. What about customer service and technical support? Is that included in the price? 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, customer service and technical support are both included in the price of the plan that you select. We offer 24/7 customer service and technical support via phone and email, so you can always reach out to us if you have any questions or issues with your service. 

Customer: That's great! One last question - do I need any special equipment or hardware in order to use your service? 

Customer Service Agent: No, all you need is a modem and router compatible with our network. If you don't have one already, we can provide a modem and router for an additional fee of $99. 

 Customer: Okay, that's all the questions I had. Thanks for your help!
