Customer Service Agent: Hi there! Welcome to Contoso Wireless. How can I help you? 

Customer: I'm really disappointed with the internet service I've been receiving from Contoso Wireless. It's been really slow and unreliable. 

Customer Service Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. We take our customer satisfaction very seriously here at Contoso Wireless, so let me see if I can help you out. What kind of internet service are you receiving? 

Customer: I'm supposed to be getting their basic broadband service but it's been incredibly slow and has a lot of dropouts. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, I understand your frustration. Can you tell me how long you've been having this issue? 

Customer: It's been going on for about two weeks now and it's driving me crazy. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let me see what I can do to help. Have you contacted our technical support team to see if they can help diagnose the issue? 

Customer: Yes, I have but they haven't been able to resolve it. They said there might be an issue with my modem or router, but I just purchased a new one and the problem persists. 

Customer Service Agent: Hmm, that's strange. Let me take a look at your account and see if there are any other issues that could be causing this problem. Can you provide me with your account number or email address? 

Customer: Sure, it's xxxxx@gmail.com 

Customer Service Agent: Great, thank you for providing that information. Let me take a look at your account now and see if there are any other issues that could be causing this problem. Please give me one moment while I investigate further...
