Customer: Hello, I am looking to purchase a streaming product from Contoso Wireless and I have a few questions about the payment process.

Agent: Hi there! I'm glad you're interested in our streaming product. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have about the payment process. What can I help you with?

Customer: How will I be charged for the product?

Agent: You'll be charged a one-time fee of $19.99 for the streaming product. This will give you access to our library of content for a full year.

Customer: Okay, great! Is there any way to pay for the product in installments?

Agent: Yes, absolutely. We offer a payment plan option that allows you to spread out the cost of the product over several months. The total cost remains the same, but you can pay in smaller increments if that's more convenient for you.

Customer: That sounds perfect! How do I sign up for the payment plan?

Agent: It's easy! All you have to do is select the payment plan option at checkout and enter your payment information. You'll be able to choose how many months you want to spread out the payments over, up to 12 months. 

Customer: Awesome! Is there any other information I should know about before signing up? 

Agent: Yes, it's important to note that we do not offer refunds on streaming products purchased through our payment plan option. Also, if your payments are late or missed, we reserve the right to cancel your subscription and revoke access to our streaming library. 

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. One last question - what methods of payment do you accept? 

Agent: We accept all major credit cards as well as PayPal and Apple Pay. 

Customer: Perfect! Thanks for all your help - I think I'm ready to sign up now. 

Agent: Great! If you need any additional assistance while signing up, please don't hesitate to reach out and we'll be happy to help. Have a great day!
