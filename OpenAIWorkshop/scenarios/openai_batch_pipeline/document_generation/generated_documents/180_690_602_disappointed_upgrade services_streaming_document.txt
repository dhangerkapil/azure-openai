Agent: Absolutely! What services are you looking to upgrade?

Customer: I'm interested in the product streaming service. Can you tell me more about it?

Agent: Sure! Product streaming is our newest service offering. It allows customers to stream content from their devices directly to their televisions without any additional equipment or setup. It's perfect for anyone who wants to watch their favorite shows and movies on the big screen. 

Customer: That sounds great! But how much does it cost?

Agent: The product streaming service costs $14.99 a month. This includes access to all of our available streaming content, plus additional benefits like discounts on other services and special offers. 

Customer: That's a bit expensive, don't you think? Are there any other options?

Agent: Yes, we do have some other options that may be more cost-effective for you. For example, we offer a basic streaming package for $9.99 a month that includes access to all of our streaming content, but doesn't include any of the additional benefits that come with the product streaming package. We also offer discounts for customers who sign up for multiple services at once, so that could be an option for you as well. 

Customer: Hmm...okay. Can you tell me more about the discounts? 

Agent: Sure! We offer discounts of up to 25% when customers sign up for multiple services at once. This can be a great way to save money while still getting all of the features and benefits of our services. 

Customer: That sounds good, but what kind of features do I get with the product streaming service? 

Agent: With the product streaming service, you'll get access to all of our available streaming content, plus additional benefits like discounts on other services and special offers. You'll also be able to stream content from your devices directly to your television without any additional equipment or setup. Plus, you'll get access to exclusive content that isn't available on other streaming platforms. 

Customer: That does sound good, but I'm still not sure if it's worth the price tag. Are there any other options? 

Agent: Yes, we do have some other options that may be more cost-effective for you. For example, we offer a basic streaming package for $9.99 a month that includes access to all of our streaming content, but doesn't include any of the additional benefits that come with the product streaming package. We also offer discounts for customers who sign up for multiple services at once, so that could be an option for you as well. 

Customer: Alright, I think I understand now. Thank you so much for your help!
