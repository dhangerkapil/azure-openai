Customer Service Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of issue are you having with the streaming service?

Customer: It's been buffering a lot and it's really slow. It's so annoying.

Customer Service Agent: I understand your frustration. Can you tell me more about what's going on? Is this happening with all streaming services or just one?

Customer: All of them. It's so slow that I can't even watch anything.

Customer Service Agent: Okay, I see. We want to make sure you have the best experience possible with our streaming services, so we'd like to look into this further. Could you provide us with more details about your issue? For example, when did it start happening and what device are you using?

Customer: It started a few days ago and I'm using my phone. It worked fine before that but now it's terrible. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, thank you for the additional information. Let me see if I can help you out with this issue. Do you mind if I take a few moments to look into it?

Customer: Sure, go ahead. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for your patience. After reviewing your account information, it looks like the streaming services have been running slower than usual due to high demand on our network lately. We're working hard to improve our network capacity to ensure that all of our customers get the best experience possible when using our streaming services. 

Customer: That's not good enough! Why didn't you tell me this earlier? I'm thinking of canceling my subscription because of this problem. 

Customer Service Agent: I understand why you might be feeling frustrated, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused by the slow streaming services. However, please know that we're constantly working to improve our network capacity and fix any issues that arise as quickly as possible so that all of our customers can enjoy a great experience with Contoso Wireless. Is there anything else I can do to help? 

Customer: No, that won't help me now. I've already wasted too much time dealing with this problem and now I'm considering switching providers because of it. 

Customer Service Agent: We understand your dissatisfaction and apologize for the poor experience you've had so far. We value your business and would love for you to stay as a customer - would it be possible for us to offer some sort of compensation or discount as an apology for the inconvenience caused by the slow streaming services?
