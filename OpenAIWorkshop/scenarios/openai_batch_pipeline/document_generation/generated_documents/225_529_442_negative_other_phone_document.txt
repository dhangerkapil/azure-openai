Customer: Hi, I recently bought a Contoso Wireless phone and it has been terrible. I don't know why I bothered to buy it in the first place.

Agent: Hi there, my name is [Agent Name], and I'm sorry to hear that you're having a bad experience with your Contoso Wireless phone. Can you tell me what's been going on?

Customer: Well, for starters, the battery life is incredibly short. It barely lasts a few hours before it needs to be charged again. And when I do charge it, it takes forever to get back up to full power. It's so frustrating!

Agent: I can understand why you're frustrated. Short battery life and slow charging times can be a real nuisance. What else have you noticed?

Customer: The screen resolution is awful - it's like looking at a fuzzy image all the time. And the camera quality is terrible - pictures taken with the phone look blurry and pixelated. It's like they didn't even bother to make the camera good!

Agent: That doesn't sound right at all. Let me take a look at your phone and see if I can figure out what might be causing these issues. Can you provide me with your order number or serial number?

Customer: Sure, it's [order number/serial number].

Agent: Thanks for providing that information. I'll take a look at your phone and see what might be causing these issues. In the meantime, I'd like to offer you a replacement phone if you'd like one. Would that help?

Customer: Yes, that would be great! Is there any way to get it quickly? I really need a phone that works properly now.

Agent: Absolutely! We can expedite the shipping process so you'll have your new phone as soon as possible. In the meantime, we'll also refund the full cost of your original purchase so you won't have to worry about that either. Is there anything else I can do for you today? 

Customer: No, that should do it for now. Thank you so much for your help!
