Customer:
"Hi, I recently purchased the Contoso Wireless streaming service and I am having issues. The service isn't working properly and I'm not getting the quality of streaming that I was promised."

Agent:
"Hello there! I apologize for the inconvenience that you are experiencing with our streaming service. I understand how frustrating it can be when technology doesn't work as expected. Can you tell me more about the issues that you are having?" 

Customer: 
"Sure, when I try to stream a movie or show it takes forever to load and then the video quality is terrible. It keeps buffering and it's really slow." 

Agent: 
"I see. That is definitely not what you should be experiencing with our streaming service. Let me take a look into this further to determine what could be causing this issue." 

Customer: 
"I've tried restarting my device and nothing seems to help. Is there something else that I can do?" 

Agent: 
"Yes, we offer an upgrade service where we can troubleshoot and diagnose the issue with your device and upgrade it to the latest software version. This should help with any streaming issues that you may be experiencing." 

Customer: 
"That sounds great but what does it cost? Is there a fee for the upgrade service?" 

Agent: 
"The upgrade service is free of charge for Contoso Wireless customers. We will provide you with a one-time upgrade and if there are any additional issues after the upgrade, we will provide additional support at no additional cost." 

Customer: 
"That's great! So how do I go about getting the upgrade service?" 

Agent: 
"It's simple! All you have to do is fill out a form on our website and we will send you a confirmation email once we receive your request. Once you receive your confirmation email, our technicians will reach out to you with instructions on how to proceed with the upgrade."
