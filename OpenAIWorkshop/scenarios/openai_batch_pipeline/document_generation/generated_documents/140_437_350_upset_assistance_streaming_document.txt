"I'm so frustrated. I just bought your product streaming service, but I can't seem to get it to work. I've tried everything, and nothing seems to be working. Can you help me?"

Agent: 
"Of course! We're here to help. Can you tell me a little bit more about the issue you're having? What type of device are you using?"

Customer: 
"I'm using an Android phone. I downloaded the app, but when I try to log in, it says my username or password is incorrect."

Agent: 
"Let's take a look at this. Can you confirm that the username and password you're entering are correct?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I'm certain they are. I've tried multiple times and it still won't work."

Agent: 
"I understand your frustration. Let's try a few troubleshooting steps. First, make sure you're connected to a strong WiFi network. Then, close out of the app completely and try again. Does that help?"

Customer: 
"No, it still won't work. Is there anything else I can do?"

Agent: 
"Let's try one more thing. Go into your device settings and clear the app data for our streaming service. That should reset the connection and allow you to log in successfully."

Customer: 
"OK, I'll give that a try. Do you think that will work?"

Agent: 
"It should! If it doesn't work this time, please feel free to contact us again and we'll look into other solutions."
