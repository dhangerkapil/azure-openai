"Hi, I'm having a lot of trouble streaming with Contoso Wireless. Can you help me out?"

Agent: 
"Hello! I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble streaming with our product. How can I help you?"

Customer: 
"I've been trying to stream for the past hour and it's been buffering constantly. Is there anything I can do to fix this?"

Agent: 
"Let me take a look into this for you. Could you provide me with a bit more information on what device you're using and what type of streaming service you're attempting to use?" 

Customer: 
"I'm using an iPhone 11 Pro Max and I'm trying to stream from Netflix."

Agent: 
"I see. Let me run some diagnostics to see what might be causing the issue. Could you please stay on the line while I do that?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, of course." 

Agent: 
"Thank you for your patience. After running the diagnostics, it looks like the issue may be related to your device's settings. Is it possible for me to remotely access your device and make some adjustments?" 

Customer: 
"Um, yeah, I guess so. Is that safe? What will happen if something goes wrong?" 

Agent: 
"Don't worry - we take security very seriously here at Contoso Wireless. Remotely accessing your device is completely safe and secure, and we guarantee that nothing will go wrong as a result of us making these changes. If anything does go wrong, we'll immediately revert the changes and work on another solution." 

Customer: 
"Ok, if you say so. Go ahead and try it." 

Agent: 
"Great! I'm now connected to your device and making some adjustments. It should only take a few moments for these changes to take effect. Do you mind if I ask how long have you been experiencing this issue?"
