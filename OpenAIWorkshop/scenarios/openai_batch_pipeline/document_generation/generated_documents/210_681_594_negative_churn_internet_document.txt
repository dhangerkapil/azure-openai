Hi, I am a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm having some issues with my internet service. I'm not getting the speeds I was promised and my connection keeps dropping. It's been really unreliable lately and I'm considering canceling my subscription. Can you help me?

Agent:

Hello there, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. We apologize for any inconvenience you have experienced with your internet service. We would like to do our best to address your concerns and ensure that you receive the service that you are expecting from us. Could you please tell us more about the issue that you are having? 

Customer:

Sure, my internet connection keeps dropping and it's been very slow for the past few weeks. I'm not getting anywhere near the speeds that were promised when I signed up for the service. Plus, my bills keep increasing every month, even though nothing about my plan has changed. I'm thinking about canceling my subscription because of this.

Agent:

We understand how frustrating this can be and we apologize again for the inconvenience caused. Before making any decisions, we would like to try and troubleshoot the issue further in order to get your internet connection back to normal as soon as possible. Could you please provide us with more information such as your current internet plan, location, etc.? 

Customer: 

I'm located in Cityville and I have the basic plan which is supposed to give me up to 10 Mbps download speeds. However, it's been really slow lately and I'm lucky if I can get 5 Mbps or less. Plus, my connection keeps dropping out which makes it even worse.

No, nothing has changed on my end since I signed up for the service two months ago.
