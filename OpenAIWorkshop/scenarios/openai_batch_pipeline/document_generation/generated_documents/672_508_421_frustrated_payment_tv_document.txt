Customer: Hi, I'm having some trouble with my Contoso Wireless bill.

Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that. How can I help?

Customer: Well, I purchased a new TV from Contoso and the bill was supposed to be added to my account, but it hasn't been yet.

Agent: Alright, let me take a look at your account and see what's going on. Could you provide me with your account number please?

Customer: Sure, it's #123456.

Agent: Thank you. Give me one moment while I check into this for you.

Agent: Alright, I've had a chance to take a look at your account and it looks like the payment for the TV has not been processed yet. We'll need to process it manually for you. Can you provide me with the details of the purchase? 

Customer: Yes, I purchased a 50-inch Smart TV from Contoso Wireless on May 15th for $500. 

Agent: Great, thank you for the information. I'm going to go ahead and process the payment for you now. It should be added to your account within 24 hours. Is there anything else I can do for you today? 

Customer: Yes, actually. Is there any way to speed up the process? I was really hoping to have the TV working by this evening. 

Agent: Unfortunately, processing payments manually can take some time and there is no way to speed up the process. However, we can offer you a $50 credit on your next bill as an apology for any inconvenience this has caused you. 

Customer: That would be great! Thank you so much for all of your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can do for you today? 

Customer: No, that's all - thank you again! 

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day!
