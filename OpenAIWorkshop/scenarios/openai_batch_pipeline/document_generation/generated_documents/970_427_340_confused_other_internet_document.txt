Hello, I'm having trouble with Contoso Wireless' internet service. Can you help me?

Agent:
Yes, absolutely. What type of issue are you having?

Customer:
Well, I'm not getting the speeds I was promised when I signed up. Can you tell me what's going on? 

Agent:
I understand. Let me look into this for you and see what I can find out. In the meantime, can you tell me what type of internet service plan you have? 

Customer:
Yes, I have the Basic Internet Plan. It says it should be up to 10 Mbps but I'm only getting about 2 Mbps. 

Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take a look at your account and see if there is anything that needs to be adjusted. Can you please provide me with your account number? 

Customer: 
Yes, my account number is 123456. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing that information. Please give me a few moments while I take a look at your account and see what adjustments need to be made to ensure that you're receiving the correct speeds. 

Customer: 
Okay, thank you for looking into this for me. 

Agent: 
You're welcome! After reviewing your account, it looks like there may have been an issue with the initial setup of your service plan which caused the lower speeds than promised. I have adjusted the settings so that you should now be receiving the correct speeds of 10 Mbps or higher. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
