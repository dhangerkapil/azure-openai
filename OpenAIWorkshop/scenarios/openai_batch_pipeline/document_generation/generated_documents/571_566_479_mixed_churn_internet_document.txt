Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your internet connection. What kind of issue are you having?

Customer: Well, it's been running really slow lately and keeps dropping out. It's making it really hard for me to do my work.

Agent: I understand how frustrating that can be. We'd hate for you to miss any deadlines because of your internet connection. Can you tell me what kind of device you're using?

Customer: Yeah, it's a Contoso Wireless router. It was working fine for a while but now it's just not cutting it. 

Agent: That's strange. Our routers are usually very reliable. Are you using the same router that came with your subscription?

Customer: Yes, it is the same one. I haven't changed anything about it since I got it. 

Agent: Alright, let's take a look at your account and see if we can figure out what the issue might be. Can I have your account number? 

Customer: Sure, here it is: [Account Number] 

Agent: Thanks! I'm going to check our records to see if there have been any changes to your account recently. Could you please hold for a few minutes while I look into this? 

Customer: Sure, no problem. 

Agent: Alright, thanks for waiting. It looks like your subscription recently expired and was not renewed. This could explain why your internet connection has been running slow and dropping out. 

Customer: Oh, so that's why it's been so bad! Is there anything I can do to fix this? 

Agent: Absolutely! We would be more than happy to renew your subscription so you can get back to enjoying our reliable internet service. We offer several different plans with different speeds and features that might suit your needs better than the plan you were on before. Would you like me to go over some of them with you? 

Customer: Sure, that would be great! 

Agent: Great! Let me just pull up the list of available plans and we can go over them one by one...
