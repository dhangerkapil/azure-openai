Customer:

Hello, I'm calling about Contoso Wireless' internet service. I'm really frustrated with the slow speeds and frequent outages. I want to know what's being done to fix it. 

Agent:

Good afternoon, I apologize for any frustration you may be experiencing. We understand that reliable internet service is important to our customers and we are working hard to make sure that our service meets your expectations. Can you tell me more about what kind of issues you've been having? 

Customer: 

I've had several outages in the past week and the speeds have been incredibly slow. My streaming services buffer all the time and I can't even get some websites to load at all. This is unacceptable and I'm getting ready to cancel my service if something isn't done soon. 

Agent: 

I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. We are aware of the issues and have been working hard to resolve them as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience while we work on improving our service. Have you tried resetting your modem or router? That often helps with speed and connection issues. 

Customer: 
Yes, I've already tried resetting my modem but it hasn't made a difference. This is getting ridiculous and I'm getting tired of waiting for a resolution. Is there anything else that can be done? 

Agent: 
We understand your frustration and apologize again for any inconvenience this has caused you. We would like to take a closer look at your account to see if we can identify the issue more precisely so that we can resolve it more quickly. Can you provide us with some additional information about your account? 

Customer: 
Yes, sure. My account number is 123456, my name is John Smith, and my address is 123 Main Street, Anytown USA. What else do you need? 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing us with that information, Mr Smith. We'll take a closer look at your account and see what we can do to improve your service as soon as possible. In the meantime, we'd like to offer you a free month of service as an apology for the trouble you've experienced recently. Would that be acceptable? 

Customer: 
Yes, that would be acceptable but I'm still not happy about this situation. I expect better from Contoso Wireless and I hope that these issues will be resolved quickly so that I don't have to consider switching providers. 

Agent: 
We understand your frustration and appreciate your patience while we work on resolving these issues as soon as possible. Rest assured that we are doing everything we can to improve our service for our customers like yourself and we will continue to work diligently until the issue is resolved. Thank you for choosing Contoso Wireless and please let us know if there's anything else we can do for you today.
