Customer: Hi, I'm having a lot of problems with your product internet. I've been trying to get it to work for hours but I can't seem to get it working. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi there! I apologize for the inconvenience. I understand how frustrating it can be when something isn't working correctly. Can you tell me more about the issue you're having?

Customer: Well, I purchased your product internet and I followed all the instructions on how to set it up, but it won't connect to my home wifi. It keeps saying there's an error and then just shuts down.

Agent: That does sound very frustrating. Is this the first time you've tried to set up your product internet?

Customer: Yes, this is the first time. I was so excited to get it working, but now I'm just feeling frustrated and disappointed.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me see if I can help you out. Could you please provide me with some more details about the issue you're having? 

Customer: Sure, every time I try to connect my product internet to my home wifi, it says there's an error and then shuts down. It's been like this for hours now and I'm getting really frustrated because nothing seems to be working. 

Agent: Alright, let me take a look into this for you and see what might be causing the issue. In the meantime, could you please tell me what type of wifi network you are using? 

Customer: Yes, it's a WPA2-PSK wifi network. 

Agent: Great, thank you for that information. Let me go ahead and check on this issue for you while you wait. 

Customer: Okay, thank you so much for your help.

Agent: Hi there, sorry for the wait! After taking a look into this issue for you, it appears that the problem is with your router settings. It looks like the router is not allowing access to your product internet due to security settings that are too strict. 

Customer: Oh no, so what can I do about this? 

Agent: Not to worry! We can easily fix this by adjusting the router settings so that your product internet will be able to connect without any issues. All we need to do is access your router settings and make a few adjustments. Do you know how to do this or would you like me to walk you through it? 

Customer: Oh yes, please walk me through it! That would be great! 

Agent: Absolutely! Let's start by accessing your router settings page. To do this, open up your web browser and type in your router's IP address in the address bar at the top of the page. This will bring up a login page where we'll need to enter in your username and password in order to access the settings page. Once we're in there, we'll be able to make adjustments so that your product internet will be able to connect without any issues. Does that make sense? 

Customer: Yes, that makes perfect sense! Thank you so much for all your help!
