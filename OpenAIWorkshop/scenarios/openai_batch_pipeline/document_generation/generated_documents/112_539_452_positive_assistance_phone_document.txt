Customer: Hi, I'm looking for some help with my Contoso Wireless phone.

Agent: Hi there, how can I help you today?

Customer: Well, I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless phone and I'm having some trouble setting it up. Can you help me?

Agent: Absolutely! What kind of issues are you having?

Customer: Well, I'm having trouble connecting to the internet. I've tried entering my wifi password multiple times, but it's not working.

Agent: Let's see what we can do. What type of phone did you purchase? 

Customer: It's a Contoso Wireless 5G model. 

Agent: Alright, let's take a look at the settings. Can you tell me which wifi network you're trying to connect to? 

Customer: Sure, it's called "Home Network". 

Agent: Okay, great. Can you open the settings menu on your phone and navigate to the wifi settings page? 

Customer: Yeah, I can do that. 

Agent: Great. Now make sure that your wifi network is enabled and that the correct network is selected. Then enter your wifi password and try to connect again. 

Customer: Okay, I'll give it a try. 

Agent: No problem! Let me know if you need any more help. 

Customer: Actually, now that I think about it, I'm also having trouble downloading apps from the app store. Is there anything else I need to do? 

Agent: Sure thing! To download apps from the app store, make sure that you're connected to wifi or have a data plan set up on your phone. Once that's done, open up the app store and search for the app you want to download. You should then be able to download it with no problems! 

Customer: Wow, thanks so much for your help! That was really helpful! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

 Customer: No, I think that's all for now. Thanks again for your help!
