Customer: 
Hi there, I'm having some issues with Contoso Wireless' internet product. Can you help me?

Agent: 
Absolutely! What seems to be the issue?

Customer: 
Well, I've been having a lot of trouble connecting to the internet. It's been really slow and it disconnects all the time. I'm worried that I might be thinking about switching providers soon.

Agent: 
I understand your frustration. I'm sorry to hear that you're having such a negative experience. Is there anything else that we can do to try and make this better for you? We want to keep you as a customer and don't want to see you go.

Customer: 
I appreciate that. But it's been like this for a while now and I don't think it's going to get any better. Do you have any discounts or promotions that could help me stay? 

Agent: 
We do have a few promotions available right now that might be able to help you out. Are you interested in learning more about them? 

Customer: 
Yes, please tell me more about them. 

Agent: 
Great! We currently have a promotion where if you sign up for a year-long plan, you get three months of service for free. We also have discounts for customers who refer friends and family, as well as discounts for customers who pay their bills on time every month. 

Customer: 
That sounds great! Do these promotions apply to existing customers or just new ones? 

Agent: 
The promotions are available for both new and existing customers. So if you decide to stay with us, these promotions would be available to you as well!
