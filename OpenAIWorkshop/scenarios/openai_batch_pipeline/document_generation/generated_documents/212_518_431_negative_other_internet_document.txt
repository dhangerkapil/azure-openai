Hello, I recently purchased your Contoso Wireless internet and I'm having some major issues. I can't seem to get the connection to stay stable for more than a few minutes. Can you help?

Agent:

Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your Contoso Wireless internet. Can you tell me a bit more about what's happening? Are you experiencing any other issues?

Customer:

Yes, the connection drops out frequently, and even when it is connected, the speed is incredibly slow. Also, I keep getting disconnected when I'm in the middle of something important. It's really frustrating.

Agent:

I completely understand your frustration. Can you tell me if there are any other devices connected to the same network that are having the same issue? 

Customer: 

Yes, all of my other devices have the same problem. Nothing seems to be working properly. It's like my internet is barely functioning. 

Agent: 

I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. We'll do our best to get this sorted out for you as quickly as possible. Is there anything else that we should be aware of? 

 Customer: 
 
Well, I've already tried restarting my router and changing the settings, but it didn't help at all. I've also checked to make sure that my subscription plan is up-to-date, and it is. 

 Agent: 

I see. In that case, let's try resetting your modem and router again just to make sure everything is working properly. After that, we can look into further troubleshooting options such as checking signal strength and verifying that all cables are securely connected. Does this sound okay? 

 Customer: 

That sounds fine. Let's give it a try and see if it helps. 

 Agent: 

All right then, let's go ahead and get started with resetting your modem and router. Please bear with us while we take care of this issue for you.
