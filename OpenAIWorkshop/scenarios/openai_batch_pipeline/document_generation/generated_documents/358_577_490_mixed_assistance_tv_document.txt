Customer: Hi, I'm looking for some assistance. I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless TV and I'm having some issues setting it up. 

Agent: Hi there, my name is Sarah and I'm here to help you out with that. How can I help?

Customer: Well, I've followed the instructions in the manual, but I'm still having trouble connecting the TV to my home network. 

Agent: That sounds like a tricky issue. Let me take a look at your TV settings and see if I can figure out what the problem might be. Can you tell me what type of router you have?

Customer: Sure, it's an AT&T U-Verse router. 

Agent: Great! Can you also tell me what type of connection you're using? Is it wired or wireless? 

Customer: It's wireless. 

Agent: Okay, that should make it easier to troubleshoot. Let me take a look at your settings and see if I can find any problems. In the meantime, can you tell me what other devices are connected to your home network? 

Customer: Yes, my laptop and my smartphone are both connected to the same network. 

Agent: Alright, that's good to know. Let me take a look at the settings on your Contoso Wireless TV now. Can you tell me what version of the software is installed on it? 

Customer: It's version 4.1. 

Agent: Perfect! Now, let me see if I can spot any problems with your settings...It looks like your router is set up correctly, but there appears to be an issue with your IP address. It looks like it needs to be updated. Let me go ahead and update it for you now and see if that solves the problem. 

Customer: Thank you so much for your help! That would be great! 

Agent: No problem at all! Just give me one moment while I update the IP address for you...Alright, it looks like that did the trick! Your Contoso Wireless TV should now be connected to your home network and ready for use! 

Customer: Wonderful! Thank you so much for your help! 

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can do for you today?
