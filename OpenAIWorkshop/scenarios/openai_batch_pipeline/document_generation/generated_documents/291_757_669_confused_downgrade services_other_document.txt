Customer: Hi, I'm looking for some help. I recently downgraded my Contoso Wireless service and now I'm not sure what product I have. Can you help me figure out what product I have?

Agent: Hi there, of course. Can you tell me a bit more about what kind of service you downgraded from?

Customer: I used to have the unlimited data plan, but now I'm not sure what product I have.

Agent: OK, so you downgraded from the unlimited data plan. Let me take a look at your account to see what type of product you now have. Can I have your account number?

Customer: Sure, it's [account number].

Agent: Alright, I've pulled up your account and it looks like you are now on the Contoso Wireless Basic plan. That includes 3GB of data per month and unlimited talk and text. Does that sound right?

Customer: Yes, that sounds right. So does that mean I can't upgrade to the unlimited data plan anymore?

Agent: That's correct. Once you downgrade a plan, you can't go back to the original plan. However, you can upgrade to any other plan that we offer that is higher than the one you currently have. Would you like me to explain all the available plans?

Customer: Yes, please. That would be great.

Agent: Certainly. We offer three different plans - Basic, Premium and Ultimate - each with varying levels of data, talk and text allowance as well as other features such as international calling and roaming. The Basic plan is our most basic plan and offers 3GB of data per month and unlimited talk and text. The Premium plan offers 10GB of data per month and all the same features as the Basic plan plus additional features such as international calling and roaming. The Ultimate plan offers 20GB of data per month plus all the same features as the Premium plan plus additional features such as priority customer service and extra storage space for photos and videos.  Is there a particular plan that interests you? 

Customer: Hmm, it sounds like the Ultimate plan might be the best option for me since it has more data than the other plans and additional features like priority customer service and extra storage space for photos and videos.  Is there any way to get a discount on this plan? 

Agent: Absolutely! We offer discounts on all our plans for customers who sign up for an annual subscription instead of a monthly subscription. Would you like to sign up for an annual subscription? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds great! How much would it cost if I signed up for an annual subscription? 

Agent: The annual cost for an Ultimate plan is $299 with a one-time setup fee of $49. Does this sound like something you would be interested in? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds perfect! How do I go about signing up for an annual subscription? 

Agent: Great! All you need to do is click on the "Sign Up Now" button on our website or give us a call at 1-800-123-4567 and one of our customer service representatives will be happy to assist you in signing up for an annual subscription.
