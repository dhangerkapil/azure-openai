Customer:
"Hi, I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless TV and I'm very disappointed. The picture quality isn't what I was expecting, and it's not what was advertised. Can you help me out?"

Agent:
"Hello, I'm sorry to hear that you're not satisfied with the product. Could you please provide me with a bit more information about the issue? What model of Contoso Wireless TV did you purchase?"

Customer: 
"I bought the HD-5500. It's supposed to have crystal clear picture quality but it's not even close."

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience. We take pride in providing our customers with the best products and services. Could you please explain the issue further? Are there any specific details that are causing you dissatisfaction?"

Customer: 
"Well, when I turn on the TV, the colors are washed out and there's a lot of pixelation. It's really blurry and it's hard to make out any detail in whatever I'm watching."

Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Could you tell me if this issue is present regardless of the source that you're using to watch content? Does it happen when you're using a streaming service or playing a DVD?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, it's happening no matter what source I use. It's really disappointing because I was expecting much better quality." 

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else that you'd like to mention about your experience with the HD-5500? We want to make sure we have all of the information necessary to help resolve your issue." 

Customer: 
"No, that's all I can think of right now. But like I said, I'm very disappointed with the picture quality and would like to find a solution." 

Agent: 
"I completely understand your frustration and we would like to help in any way we can. We have a few options available that might be able to help resolve this issue. Would you like me to explain them?" 

Customer: 
"Yes please, I'd like to know what my options are." 

Agent: 
"Certainly. We can either provide you with a replacement TV that has been tested and certified to meet our standards for picture quality, or we can send one of our technicians to troubleshoot your current TV and make any necessary adjustments or repairs. Which option would you prefer?"
