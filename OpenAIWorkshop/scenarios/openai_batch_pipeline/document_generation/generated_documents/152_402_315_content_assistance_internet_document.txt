Hello, I'm having trouble with the internet connection on my Contoso Wireless device. Could you help me?

Agent:
Hello there! I'd be more than happy to help. Could you tell me more about what's going on?

Customer:
Sure. My internet connection keeps dropping and I can't seem to stay connected for more than a few minutes at a time. 

Agent:
I see. Could you tell me what kind of Contoso Wireless device you have? 

Customer: 
I have the Contoso Wireless Model C. 

Agent: 
Thanks for letting me know. Can you tell me if you've tried resetting the device yet? 

Customer: 
Yes, I've already tried that but it hasn't worked. 

Agent: 
Ok, no worries. I think we can figure out the issue. Can you tell me if there are any other wireless devices in your home or any other electronic devices that might be causing interference? 

Customer: 
Yes, I do have a few other devices in my home that use wireless technology such as a laptop, tablet, and smartphone. 

Agent: 
Ok, great. It looks like the issue might be caused by interference from these other devices. To fix this, try turning off all the wireless devices in your home except for your Contoso Wireless device and then try connecting again to see if that helps. Let me know how it goes!
