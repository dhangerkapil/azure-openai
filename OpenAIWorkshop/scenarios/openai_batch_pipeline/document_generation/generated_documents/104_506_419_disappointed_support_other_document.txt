Customer:
Good morning, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm very disappointed with the service I've been receiving. I recently purchased one of your products, but it doesn't seem to be working properly. Can you help me out?

Agent:
Hello, I apologize for the inconvenience. What product are you having difficulty with?

Customer:
I bought a Contoso Wireless router a few days ago and it's not working correctly. Every time I try to connect it just keeps dropping the signal. 

Agent:
I'm sorry to hear that. Is this the first time you've had an issue with this router? 

Customer:
Yes, it's the first time. I was really hoping this router would be reliable but it's been nothing but trouble since I got it.

Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this can be. Can you tell me a bit more about what is happening when you try to connect? 

Customer: 
Well, whenever I turn on the router, it will connect for a few seconds and then suddenly drop the connection. This keeps happening over and over again and nothing seems to fix it. 

Agent: 
That does sound like a problem. Have you tried resetting the router or updating its firmware? 

Customer: 
Yes, I have tried both of those things but they didn't seem to help at all. 

Agent: 
I see. Well, let me take a look at your account and see what else we can do to help you out. Can you provide me with your account information so that I can access your account? 

Customer: 
Sure, my account number is XXXXXXX and my name is John Smith. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing that information. Let me take a look at your account and see what we can do to help you out. In the meantime, is there anything else that I can help you with today?
