Customer: 
"Hello, I'm not happy with the service I'm receiving from Contoso Wireless. I recently downgraded my services and I'm having a lot of trouble with the product streaming. Can you help me out?"

Agent: 
"I apologize for any issues you are experiencing with your product streaming. I'll be more than happy to help you out. Can you tell me a bit more about what is happening?"

Customer: 
"Well, it's been very slow lately. I can't even watch a movie without it buffering every few minutes. And when I try to use my phone data, it still doesn't work!"

Agent: 
"I see. Well, unfortunately downgrading your service may have impacted the speed of your product streaming. Are there any other issues you are experiencing?"

Customer: 
"Yes, my phone data is really slow too. It takes forever to load websites or send messages. What can be done to fix this?"

Agent: 
"I understand that this is frustrating. We do offer some additional data packages that may help improve the speed of your phone data. Would you like to explore these options?"

Customer: 
"Yes, please tell me more about them."

Agent: 
"We offer a variety of different packages, ranging from 1GB of extra data all the way up to 10GB of extra data. These packages are available for purchase on a monthly basis and can be added to your current plan for an additional fee."

Customer: 
"What kind of speeds can I expect from these packages? Will it be enough for me to watch movies without buffering?"

Agent: 
"With our extra data packages, you should be able to stream movies without any buffering or lag issues. The speeds will vary depending on the package you choose, but they should be more than sufficient for streaming purposes."
