Hello and thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. My name is [name] and I'm here to help. How may I assist you today? 

Customer:

Yes, hi. I'm trying to figure out why I was charged for a streaming product that I didn't even order. Can you explain what happened? 

Customer Service Agent:

Certainly. Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on. Could you please provide your account number? 

Customer: 

Yes, sure. It's [account number]. 

Customer Service Agent: 

Thank you. It looks like the charge was for a streaming product that was added to your account. Is this something you requested? 

Customer: 
No, I didn't request any streaming products. I don't even know what that is. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I apologize for any confusion this may have caused. The streaming product is a service we offer that allows you to access certain content from our website without needing to download it onto your device first. It's a convenient way to watch movies or shows on the go without taking up too much space on your device. 

 Customer: 
Ah, okay, that makes sense. But why was I charged for it if I didn't even request it? 

 Customer Service Agent: 
It appears that the charge was an error on our end. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. We will be issuing a full refund for the charge and removing the streaming product from your account as well. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
