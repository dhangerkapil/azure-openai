Customer Service Agent: Hi, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. How may I help you?

Customer: Hi, I recently received a bill from Contoso Wireless that I don't understand. It says that I owe more money than I usually do. What is going on?

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me what product or service you are inquiring about?

Customer: Yes, it's for my mobile phone plan.

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let me take a look at your account. Can you please provide me with your account number?

Customer: Sure, it's [account number]. 

Customer Service Agent: Thanks, I have pulled up your account. It looks like there was a recent increase in your monthly plan charges due to the addition of a new line. Is that correct? 

Customer: No, that's not correct. I haven't added any new lines to my plan. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the confusion. Let me take a look at this further. Could you please confirm the number of lines on your account? 

Customer: Yes, there are only two lines on my account - mine and my wife's. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, thank you for the confirmation. It looks like there was an error in our billing system and your account was mistakenly charged for a third line that does not exist on your plan. I have corrected the error and adjusted your bill accordingly. Your new balance should now reflect the correct amount due for your plan. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: Yes, actually I wanted to ask about adding another line to my plan. Is that possible? 

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! We would be more than happy to add another line to your plan and provide you with a new device if needed. Would you like to discuss any details about adding another line to your plan today?
