Customer: Hi, I'm having some trouble with my internet service. Can you help me? 

Agent: Hi there, I'd be happy to help. What seems to be the problem? 

Customer: Well, I've had Contoso Wireless for about a month now and the internet connection has been spotty at best. It's been dropping out randomly and I can't seem to figure out why. 

Agent: Hmm, that's definitely not what we want to hear. Let me see if I can get this figured out for you. What type of device are you using to connect to our internet service? 

Customer: I'm using a laptop with Windows 10. 

Agent: Okay, let's start by taking a look at the router settings. Could you please confirm the current router settings? 

Customer: Sure, I can do that. 

Agent: Great! Please go ahead and check the current router settings and let me know what they are. 

Customer: Okay, so the current settings are as follows: SSID is Contoso Wireless; security mode is WPA2-Personal; encryption type is AES; channel is 6; wireless mode is b/g/n; IP address is 192.168.1.1; subnet mask is 255.255.255.0; default gateway is 192.168.1.1; DNS server is 192.168.1.1; and DHCP is enabled. 

Agent: Alright, those all look correct for our service. Let's try resetting the router and see if that helps with the connection issue you're experiencing. Please go ahead and power cycle the router by unplugging it from the wall for 10 seconds and then plugging it back in again after that time period has elapsed. 

Customer: Okay, I'll give it a try now and see if that helps resolve the issue. 

Agent: Great! Please keep me posted on how it goes once you've powered cycled the router and let me know if there's anything else I can do to help you out with this issue today! 

Customer: Will do! Thank you for your help so far!
