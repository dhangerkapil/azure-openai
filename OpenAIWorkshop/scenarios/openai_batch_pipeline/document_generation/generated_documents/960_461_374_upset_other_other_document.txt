Agent: 
"I apologize for any inconvenience you have experienced. Can you tell me more about what is happening with your device?"

Agent: 
"I understand. We take our customer satisfaction very seriously here at Contoso Wireless, so let's see if we can find a solution. What type of phone did you purchase?"
