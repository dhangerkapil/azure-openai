Agent: Hi there! How can I help you today?

Customer: I recently purchased one of your products and I'm having some trouble setting it up. Is there someone who can help me?

Agent: Certainly! What product did you purchase?

Customer: It's the Contoso Wireless home router.

Agent: Okay, great. Let me see what I can do to help you out. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue you're having? 

Customer: Sure. I've followed all the setup instructions, but when I plug in the router, it doesn't seem to be working. It just flashes a few times and then nothing happens. 

Agent: Alright, let's take a look at that. Is the router plugged into an outlet that is connected to power? 

Customer: Yes, it is. 

Agent: Great. Can you please check to make sure the power switch on the back of the router is in the 'on' position? 

Customer: Yes, it is on. 

Agent: Okay, can you please try unplugging the router from the outlet and then plugging it back in? Make sure it's securely plugged in before turning it on again. 

Customer: Alright, I'll give that a try. 

Agent: Great! If that doesn't work, could you please try resetting the router by pressing and holding down the reset button for 15 seconds? 

Customer: Sure thing, I'll give that a try. 

Agent: Perfect! If none of those methods work, please don't hesitate to contact us again and we'll be more than happy to help you out further. 

Customer: Sounds good, thank you for your help!
