Hello and welcome to Contoso Wireless. How may I help you today?

Customer:
I'm not happy. I recently downgraded my services and now I'm having problems with my TV. What is going on?

Customer Service Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please tell me more about the issue you are experiencing with your TV?

Customer:
It's really slow and choppy. It's almost like it's buffering all the time, even when I'm trying to watch something that's already been recorded. It's really frustrating. 

Customer Service Agent:
I understand your frustration. It sounds like there may be an issue with your internet connection. Can you please check the speed of your internet connection to make sure it meets our minimum requirements for streaming TV? 

Customer:
I already did that. The speed is fine, so it must be an issue with the service. 

Customer Service Agent:
I see. It is possible that the downgrade of your service plan could have impacted your streaming capabilities, as some of our plans include streaming bonuses that could improve your experience. Is there any way we can upgrade your service plan in order to better accommodate your needs? 

Customer:
No, I don't want to upgrade my service plan right now. I just want to know why my TV isn't working correctly after downgrading my service plan. 

Customer Service Agent:
I understand. Let me take a look at what could be causing this issue. Could you please give me a few moments while I investigate? 

Customer: 
Sure, but please hurry up because this is really annoying me. 

 Customer Service Agent: 
I apologize for the inconvenience, and I assure you that I am doing my best to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. After looking into it, it appears that the downgrade of your service plan may have caused an interruption in your streaming capabilities due to a change in bandwidth allocation for streaming services. We can try to adjust the settings on your account to restore normal streaming performance, if you would like.
