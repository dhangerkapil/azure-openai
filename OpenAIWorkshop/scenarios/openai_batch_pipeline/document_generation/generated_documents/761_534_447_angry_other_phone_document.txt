"I am so angry! I bought a phone from Contoso Wireless and it doesn't work. I'm so frustrated and disappointed. What kind of company are you running here?

Customer: 
It won't turn on! I bought it just yesterday and it's already broken. This is ridiculous. I want a refund right now!

I understand how upsetting this must be for you. We do not want you to be dissatisfied with your purchase, so we will certainly do our best to make things right. Can you provide me with your order number and any other details about the product? 

Customer: 
Yes, the order number is 123456789. I paid for an iPhone 12 Pro Max, and it's not working at all. I want my money back right away! 

Agent: 
Thank you for the information. Please allow me a few moments while I look into this issue for you. 

Customer: 
What is taking so long? This isn't fair! I'm already very unhappy and now I'm being kept waiting too? 

Agent: 
I apologize for the delay. I am doing my best to investigate this issue and ensure that you are given a fair resolution as quickly as possible. Can you please confirm what happens when you try to turn on the device? 

Customer: 
Nothing happens when I press the power button! It's completely unresponsive, like it's dead or something! This is ridiculous, why would I pay all that money for something that doesn't even work?
