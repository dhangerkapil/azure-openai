Hello, and thank you for reaching out to Contoso Wireless. How may I help you?

Yes, I have a cell phone plan, and I also recently purchased a TV from Contoso.

Thanks for the information. Let me take a look at your account and see what options we can offer for savings on your bill. Could you please verify your name and account number?

 Okay, it looks like you are currently subscribed to our basic cell phone plan and you recently purchased our Contoso TV package. Is this correct? 

 Customer: 
 Yes, that's right. 

 Agent: 
 Great! It looks like we have some promotional discounts available on both of these services which could help reduce your bill. Would you like to hear more about them? 

 Customer: 
 Yes, please let me know what discounts are available!
