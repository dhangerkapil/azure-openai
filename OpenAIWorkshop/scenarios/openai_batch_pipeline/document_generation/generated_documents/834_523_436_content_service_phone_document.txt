Agent: Hi there! Welcome to Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer: Well, I'm having some trouble with the phone. It's not connecting to the internet properly.

Agent: That's not good. Can you tell me a bit more about what's happening?

Customer: Sure. Whenever I try to connect to the internet, it just says "Unable to Connect."

Agent: Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Is your phone connected to a Wi-Fi network or are you using mobile data? 

Customer: I'm connected to a Wi-Fi network. 

Agent: Okay, let's take a look at that. Can you tell me which Wi-Fi network you're connected to? 

Customer: Sure, it's called "ABC Network." 

Agent: Alright, let's see if we can get this sorted out for you. Can you try disconnecting from the ABC Network and then reconnecting? 

Customer: Sure, I'll give it a try. 

Agent: Great! Please let me know if that works for you. 

Customer: Okay, it looks like it worked! Thanks for your help. 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: Actually, yes. Can you tell me how to change my phone settings so that my Wi-Fi automatically connects when I'm in range of the network? 

Agent: Absolutely! Let me walk you through the steps. First, open up your phone settings and select "Wi-Fi". Then tap on the name of the network you want to connect to and make sure the toggle switch next to "Auto-Connect" is turned on. 

Customer: Got it! Thanks again for all your help today. 

Agent: You're very welcome! Have a great day!
