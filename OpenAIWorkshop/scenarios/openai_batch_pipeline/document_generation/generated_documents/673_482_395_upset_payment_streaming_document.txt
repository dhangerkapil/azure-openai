Customer: Yes, I'm having an issue with my payment. I signed up for the product streaming service and I'm not sure why I was charged for it.

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you provide me with your account information so that I can look into this further?

Customer: Sure. My account name is JSmith and my account number is 1234567.

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for providing that information. Please allow me a few moments while I investigate this further.

(After a few moments of investigation)

Customer Service Agent: Alright, I was able to locate your account and it looks like you have subscribed to the product streaming service on our website. You were charged the standard rate of $9.99 for this service. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: No, that makes sense but what does the product streaming service include?

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! The product streaming service includes access to our online library of movies, TV shows, music, games, and more! You can also access exclusive discounts on products within our store as well as early access to new releases. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: No, that sounds great but why wasn't I notified before being charged? 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the lack of communication in this case. We typically send out an email prior to charging customers so they are aware of what they are signing up for. However, it looks like this did not occur in your case. We will make sure to look into this and ensure that our processes are followed in the future. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: No, that's all for now thank you for your help.
