Customer Service Agent: 
Hello, this is Contoso Wireless. How may I help you?

Customer:
I'm so angry right now. I just purchased your product streaming service, and it's not working at all! I'm not getting the speed that I was promised. This is unacceptable!

Customer Service Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me what issue you're having specifically with the product streaming?

Customer:
Yes, I'm getting incredibly slow speeds. The service is not living up to its promise. It's been two days and nothing has changed.

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this can be. Have you tried restarting your device or rebooting your router? This could potentially help resolve the issue you're having with the streaming service. 

Customer: 
Yes, I've done that multiple times and it hasn't made any difference. I've followed all of the instructions on your website and nothing is working. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. Let me take a look into this for you and see if there's anything else we can do to help resolve the issue you're having with the product streaming service. Can you provide me with your account information so I can take a closer look? 

Customer: 
Yes, of course. My account information is xxxxxxxx. Please hurry up and figure out what's wrong so I can get back to using your service as soon as possible. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Thank you for providing your account information. I will investigate this issue further and get back to you as soon as possible with an update on our progress in resolving the issue with the product streaming service. In the meantime, is there anything else that I can help you with? 

Customer: 
No, that's all for now. Just hurry up and figure out what's wrong so I can start using your service again!
