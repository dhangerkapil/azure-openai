Customer: Hi, I just purchased a Contoso Wireless TV, but I’m having some issues with it. Can you help?

Agent: Of course! We take great pride in our customer service. What kind of issue are you having?

Customer: The picture quality is terrible and the sound is distorted. It doesn’t seem to be working correctly.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me see what I can do to help. Could you provide me with the model number of your TV?

Customer: Sure, it’s CWT-12345.

Agent: Thanks for the information. Can you tell me when you first noticed the issue?

Customer: It was right out of the box. I’ve tried adjusting the settings and nothing seems to work. It’s really disappointing because I was expecting a great product from Contoso Wireless.

Agent: I understand how frustrating this must be for you. We value your satisfaction and will do our best to make sure this gets resolved as quickly as possible. Have you tried unplugging the TV and plugging it back in?

Customer: Yes, but that didn’t seem to help. Is there anything else I can try?

Agent: Yes, we recommend performing a factory reset on the TV. This will reset all of the settings back to their original settings and may help resolve any technical issues that may be causing the problem. To perform a factory reset, press and hold down both the power button and volume down button for 10 seconds until the screen goes blank and then release both buttons. Then press and hold down both buttons again until the TV turns back on and release both buttons again. After this is done, try adjusting the picture settings again to see if this helps improve the quality of your picture and sound. 

Customer: Ok, I’ll give that a try. Thanks for your help. 

Agent: You’re welcome! Please let me know if there’s anything else I can do to help or if this didn’t resolve your issue.
