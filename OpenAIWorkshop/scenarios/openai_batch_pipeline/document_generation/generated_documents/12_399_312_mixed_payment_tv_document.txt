Customer: Hi there, I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless TV and I'm having trouble making a payment. Can you help?

Agent: Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that. What type of payment issue are you having?

Customer: Well, I tried to pay using my debit card but the transaction wasn't approved. It says it was declined by the issuer.

Agent: Hmm, that's strange. Could you provide me with the last four digits of the card you were using so I can look into this further?

Customer: Sure, it's 5678.

Agent: Okay, thank you for that information. Give me one moment while I check on this for you.

(After a few moments)

Agent: Alright, it looks like the payment was declined because there are insufficient funds in your account. Is there another form of payment you'd like to use?

Customer: Yes, I can use my credit card instead if that works. 

Agent: Absolutely! That should work just fine. Please provide me with the last four digits of your credit card and I'll process the payment for you. 

Customer: It's 1234. 

Agent: Great, thank you for that information. I'm processing the payment now and it should go through without any issues. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should be it. Thank you for your help!
