Customer: I'm so angry. I recently signed up for Contoso Wireless streaming and I am already having billing issues! I need to know what's going on and why my bill is so high.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please provide me with some more information about the issue?

Customer: Yes, my bill for this month is twice as much as it was last month. I don't understand why it's so high.

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. Let me look into this and see what's going on. Can you please confirm your account number and the date of the billing cycle?

Customer: Sure, my account number is 12345 and the billing cycle is the 20th of each month.

Agent: Great, thank you for that information. I am looking into the issue now and will get back to you shortly with an update. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns about Contoso Wireless streaming?

Customer: Yes, I want to know why there are so many additional fees on my bill. What are they for? 

Agent: We appreciate your feedback. Additional fees can vary from one customer to another depending on their service plan and usage. For example, if you are using more data than your plan allows, or if you have added additional features like international calling, those will be reflected in your bill as additional fees. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Please let me know when you find out what's causing my bill to be so high this month. 

Agent: Absolutely! I will get back to you with an update as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience and have a great day!
