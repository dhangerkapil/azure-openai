Customer: Hi, I'm looking to sign up for Contoso Wireless and I have a few questions about the streaming product.

Agent: Hi there, thank you for your interest in Contoso Wireless! I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about our streaming product. Can you tell me what specific details you are interested in?

Customer: Sure, I was curious about what types of content are available on the streaming service.

Agent: Absolutely! Our streaming service offers a wide variety of content, including movies, TV shows, music, and more. We are always adding new content to our library so there is always something new to watch.

Customer: That sounds great! What are the different subscription plans available?

Agent: We offer several subscription plans to fit your needs. Our basic plan offers access to all of our content for a low monthly fee. We also have a premium plan which offers additional content and features such as ad-free streaming and access to exclusive content.

Customer: Okay, that's helpful. What happens if I cancel my subscription? 

Agent: If you decide to cancel your subscription, you will not be charged for any additional months and your account will be closed immediately. However, you will still be able to access all of the content you have already downloaded until the end of your billing cycle. 

Customer: Alright, that makes sense. Are there any restrictions on how many devices I can stream from at once? 

Agent: Yes, our streaming service allows up to five devices to be connected at once. You can also link your account with other members of your household so that everyone can enjoy the same content without having to purchase separate subscriptions. 

Customer: That's great! One more question - is there a way to watch content offline? 

Agent: Yes, our streaming service allows you to download content onto compatible devices so that you can watch it offline whenever you want. Just make sure that you have enough storage space on your device before downloading any content. 

Customer: Okay, that's all the questions I had for now. Thank you for all the information! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
