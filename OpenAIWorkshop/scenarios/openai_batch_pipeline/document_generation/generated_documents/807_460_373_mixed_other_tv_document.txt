Customer: Hi, I'm having a problem with my Contoso Wireless TV. It's not working properly.

Agent: Hello, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your Contoso Wireless TV. Can you tell me more about the issue you're experiencing?

Customer: Yes, the TV won't turn on and when it does, the picture is blurry and choppy.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take a look at your account and see what might be causing the issue. Can I get your account information so I can look into this for you?

Customer: Sure, my account number is 1234567890.

Agent: Thank you for that information. Let me take a few minutes to look into this and see what might be causing the issue. 

Customer: Okay, thank you. 

Agent: Alright, it looks like there was an issue with your connection and the signal was weak. That could be causing the picture to be blurry and choppy when it does turn on. I recommend trying to reset your router and see if that helps improve your signal strength. 

Customer: Okay, I'll try that. Is there anything else I should do? 

Agent: Yes, if that doesn't work then you should check your power source and make sure it's plugged in properly. If it still doesn't work after that then I recommend contacting us again so we can further investigate the issue. 

Customer: Alright, thanks for the help. 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thank you again for your help! 

Agent: My pleasure! Have a great day!
