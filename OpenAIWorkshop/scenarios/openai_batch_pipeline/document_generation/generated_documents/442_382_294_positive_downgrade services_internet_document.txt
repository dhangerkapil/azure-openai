Agent: Hi there! It's great to hear that you're interested in changing your service. We have a few options for downgrading your internet package. How much data do you currently have? 

Customer: I have the unlimited data plan, but it's too expensive for my budget. 

Agent: I understand. We do have some packages with a lower cost. Our mid-level plan has 10GB of data per month and our low-level plan has 5GB of data per month. Would either of these packages work for you? 

Customer: That would be perfect! How much does each plan cost? 

Agent: The mid-level plan is $50 per month and the low-level plan is $30 per month. Both plans include unlimited text and talk minutes. 

Customer: Wow, that's great! Can I switch to the low-level plan right away? 

Agent: Absolutely! All you need to do is log into your account on our website and make the switch there. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thanks for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day!
