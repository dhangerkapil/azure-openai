"I am so frustrated! I just bought a Contoso Wireless product and it isn't working. What is going on?"

Agent: 
"I apologize for your frustration, and I am here to help you. Can you tell me more about what's going on with your Contoso Wireless product?"

Customer: 
"Well, it won't turn on. I've tried everything but nothing seems to work."

Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating this must be. Can you tell me what product you have purchased?" 

Customer: 
"It's the Other model from Contoso Wireless. I was told it was the best one for my needs." 

Agent: 
"The Other model is a great choice for many people. Can you describe what steps you have already taken to try and get it working?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, I've tried plugging it in to multiple outlets, resetting the device, and checking all the connections. Nothing has worked." 

Agent: 
"Okay, thank you for taking those steps. We will need to investigate this further to determine what might be causing the issue. Can I ask if you are using the original power cable that came with the device?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, I'm using the original power cable that came with the device." 

Agent: 
"Thank you for confirming that. I will now need to ask some additional questions about your product and its setup so that we can determine why it is not turning on."
