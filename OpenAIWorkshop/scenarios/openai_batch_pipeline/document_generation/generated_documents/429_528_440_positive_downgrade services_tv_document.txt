Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that you would like to downgrade your service. What type of service are you looking to downgrade?

Customer: I have the TV package, so I'd like to know what options I have for downgrading that.

Agent: Sure! We have a few different options for downgrading your TV package. For starters, we can switch you to a basic plan that offers only the basic channels and does not include the premium channels. You'll still get the same amount of HD channels as before but with fewer additional channels. 

Customer: That sounds great. How much would this cost?

Agent: The basic plan will cost you $50 per month and includes all the same features as our standard plan, minus the premium channels. 

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. What other options do I have for downgrading my TV package? 

Agent: We also offer an economy plan that provides the same amount of HD channels as before but with fewer additional channels and no access to premium channels. This plan is priced at $40 per month. 

Customer: That sounds like a great option! What other features are included in this plan? 

Agent: In addition to the HD channels, you will also get access to our on-demand library which has thousands of movies and TV shows available for streaming anytime you want. You will also get access to our parental control feature which allows you to set limits on what your kids can watch on TV. 

Customer: That sounds great! How long does it take for the downgrade to take effect? 

Agent: It usually takes about 2 business days for the downgrade to take effect once you submit your request. Once it's done, you'll be able to enjoy your new plan immediately! 

Customer: That's great, thank you so much for all your help! 

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
