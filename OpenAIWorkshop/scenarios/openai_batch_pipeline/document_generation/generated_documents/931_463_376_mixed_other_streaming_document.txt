That's great! I'm interested in the unlimited plan, but I'm curious if there are any restrictions on what I can watch?

No, there are no restrictions on what you can watch with our unlimited plan. You have full access to our entire library of content, so you can watch whatever you like. Is there anything else I can help you with?
