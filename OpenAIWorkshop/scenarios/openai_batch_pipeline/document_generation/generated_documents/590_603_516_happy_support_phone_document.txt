Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble with my Contoso Wireless phone. Can you help me?

Agent: Of course! I'm happy to help. What kind of issue are you having?

Customer: Well, I just got the phone and it won't turn on.

Agent: I see. That's not good. Let's try to get it fixed for you. Can you tell me what model phone you have? 

Customer: It's the Contoso Wireless Galaxy S10.

Agent: Okay, let me check on that for you. Is your phone plugged in to a power source? 

Customer: Yes, it is. 

Agent: Alright, I'm going to try a few things here. Can you tell me if you've tried to restart the device? 

Customer: Yes, I have restarted it several times but nothing is happening. 

Agent: Okay, that's not a problem. Let me try some troubleshooting steps here and see if we can get this fixed for you. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about the device? 

Customer: No, go ahead. 

Agent: Great! First, can you tell me what version of Android you are running? 

Customer: It's Android 10. 

Agent: Alright, that's good news! Let me run a few more tests here and see if I can pinpoint the issue. Do you know if there are any pending updates on the device? 

Customer: No, there aren't any updates pending right now. 

Agent: Okay, that's great! Let me try one more thing here and see if we can get this sorted out for you. Can you tell me what kind of apps or software is installed on your phone? 

Customer: Yes, there are a few games installed as well as some productivity apps like Microsoft Office and Google Drive. 

Agent: Perfect! Let me take a look at those apps and see if they could be causing an issue with the phone turning on. In the meantime, can you try removing the battery from the device and then re-inserting it after about 30 seconds? 

 Customer: Sure, I'll give it a try!

 Agent: Alright, give that a shot and let me know how it goes. If that doesn't work then we may need to look into replacing the battery or doing a factory reset of the device.
