Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you are unhappy with your purchase. Could you tell me more about what features you were expecting?

Customer: I was told that this product would have the ability to connect to other devices and perform various tasks. But it doesn't seem to do that at all.

Agent: I see. Let me take a look at your purchase and see if there is something we can do. Can you provide me with the product information so that I can look into this further?

Customer: Sure, here is the product code: XXXXXX.

Agent: Thanks for providing the product code. I'm going to take a look and see what I can find out for you. In the meantime, can you tell me a bit more about what you were expecting the product to do?

Agent: Alright, thank you for providing more information. Let me take a look at this and see if there is something we can do for you. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns?
