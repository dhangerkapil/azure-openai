Customer: Hi, I'm looking to purchase a new television from Contoso Wireless. Do you have any payment options?

Agent: Hi there! We sure do have payment options. We offer a variety of payment plans to help make our products more accessible to our customers. Are you interested in a full payment or a payment plan?

Customer: I'd like to know more about the payment plan. Can you tell me what that entails?

Agent: Absolutely! Our payment plans are broken down into three-month, six-month, and twelve-month periods. Each period has its own unique benefits, including low monthly payments and no interest. 

Customer: That sounds great! What kind of televisions do you offer?

Agent: We offer a wide range of televisions, from basic models to the latest high-end models. We also carry a selection of refurbished models, which can save you money while still giving you access to the latest technology. 

Customer: That's really helpful. Can you tell me more about the payment plans for these televisions? 

Agent: Sure! For all of our televisions, we offer three-month, six-month, and twelve-month payment plans. All of these plans come with no interest, so you can pay off your purchase over time without worrying about accruing extra fees or charges. 

Customer: That's great! What kind of terms are available for each of these plans? 

Agent: For the three-month plan, we require a minimum purchase of $500 and allow up to $2,000 in purchases per transaction. The six-month plan requires a minimum purchase of $1,000 and allows up to $3,000 in purchases per transaction. Finally, the twelve-month plan requires a minimum purchase of $2,000 and allows up to $4,000 in purchases per transaction. 

Customer: Okay, so if I make a purchase over $2,000 then I can spread out my payments over 12 months with no interest? 

Agent: That's correct! As long as your purchase is over $2,000 then you can take advantage of our twelve-month payment plan with no interest. 

Customer: Perfect! That's exactly what I was looking for. Do you have any special offers or promotions that I can take advantage of? 

Agent: Yes! We're currently offering a 10% discount on all purchases over $1,000 if you sign up for our newsletter. This is only available for a limited time so make sure to take advantage while it lasts! 

Customer: Great! Signing up for the newsletter is definitely something I'll look into. Thanks so much for your help!
