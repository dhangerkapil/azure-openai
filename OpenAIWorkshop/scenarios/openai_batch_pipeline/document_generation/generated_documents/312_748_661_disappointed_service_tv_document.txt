Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless TV and I am disappointed with the service. I don't think it's working properly. Can you help?

Agent: Hi there! I apologize for the inconvenience you are having with your Contoso Wireless TV. Let's see what we can do to get it up and running properly. Can you tell me more about the issue you are experiencing?

Customer: Well, when I turn it on, it won't connect to the internet. It just keeps searching and searching and nothing ever happens.

Agent: I understand your frustration. Let's see if we can get this sorted out. First, can you confirm that the TV is connected to your WiFi network?

Customer: Yes, I checked that already. It says that it is connected but still won't connect to the internet.

Agent: Okay, great. Is there anything else that you have tried so far to try and resolve this issue? 

Customer: Yes, I have tried resetting the TV multiple times, but it still won't work. 

Agent: Alright, let's try a few other troubleshooting steps before we move on to more complex solutions. Can you please unplug the TV from the power outlet for 10 seconds and then plug it back in? Then try to connect again to your WiFi network and see if that resolves the issue. 

Customer: Okay, I will give that a try and see what happens. 

Agent: Great! Please let me know how it goes. 

Customer: Alright, I did as you said and it still won't connect to the internet. 

Agent: That's not good news, but don't worry we'll figure this out together! Could you please provide me with your TV's serial number so I can look into this further? 

Customer: Sure, here is my serial number [serial number]. 

Agent: Thanks for providing that information! Let me check our system and see what we can do to resolve this issue for you. In the meantime, could you please confirm that all cables are properly connected and that no settings have been changed on your router? 

Customer: Yes, everything is connected correctly and no settings have been changed on my router. 

Agent: Perfect! Please give me one moment while I investigate further into this issue for you. 

 After a few moments of researchâ€¦

 Agent: Okay, so after looking into this further it looks like there may be an issue with your Contoso Wireless TV's firmware. To resolve this issue I recommend updating the firmware by downloading the latest version from our website onto a USB drive and then connecting the drive to your TV in order for the update to take place. Once the update is complete, restart your TV and try connecting again to your WiFi network to see if this resolves the issue for you. 

 Customer: Alright, that sounds like a good plan! I will give that a try and see what happens. 

 Agent: Wonderful! Please let me know how it goes once you have tried updating the firmware on your Contoso Wireless TV. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
