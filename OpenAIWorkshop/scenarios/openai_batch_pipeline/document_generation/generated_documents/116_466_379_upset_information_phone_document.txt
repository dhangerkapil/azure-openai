Good afternoon! My name is Jane and I am a customer service agent with Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer:
I recently purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and I need some information. 

Customer Service Agent: 
No problem! What kind of information do you need?

Customer: 
I want to know more about the features of the phone, such as the camera quality, battery life, and other specifications.

Customer Service Agent: 
Absolutely! I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. The camera on this phone has a 16-megapixel rear-facing lens with a 5-megapixel front-facing lens. It also has a battery life of up to 24 hours with normal usage. As for other specs, the phone has a 4GB RAM and 32GB storage capacity, and runs on Android 8.0 operating system. Does that answer your question? 

Customer: 
Yes, but what about the warranty information? Is there any coverage for repair or replacement if something goes wrong with the phone? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, we offer a one-year warranty for repair or replacement if something goes wrong with your phone. The warranty also covers accidental damage, such as drops or spills. You can find more information about our warranty policy on our website.
