Hello, I'm having trouble with my Contoso Wireless service. I recently purchased internet service, but I'm having issues with the payment. Can you help me?

Agent:
Of course! I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble. Could you please tell me more about the issue you're experiencing?

Customer:
Yes, I purchased the internet service last week, and I was expecting a payment to be processed for it, but it hasn't gone through yet. Is there something wrong?

Agent:
Let me check on that for you. Can you please provide me with your account number and the date of purchase? That will help me to look into this further.

Sure, my account number is 867-5309 and I purchased the service on October 28th.
