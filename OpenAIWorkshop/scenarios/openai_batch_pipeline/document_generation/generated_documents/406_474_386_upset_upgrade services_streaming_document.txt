Customer Service Agent: Hi there! Thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, I recently upgraded my service with Contoso and I'm having trouble streaming. I was told that I would be able to stream without any issues and that hasn't been the case.

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. We take our customer's satisfaction very seriously here at Contoso Wireless. Can you please provide me with more details about your streaming issue?

Customer: Yes, I'm trying to stream a movie but it keeps buffering and freezing. It's been like this for a few days now.

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let me look into this issue for you. Can you please confirm your account number so I can access your account information?

Customer: Sure, my account number is 12345678. 

Customer Service Agent: Great, thank you for providing that information. I am now accessing your account information and looking into the streaming issue you're experiencing. Can you please tell me which device you are using to stream? 

Customer: I'm using an iPhone 8 Plus. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, thank you for confirming that information. Can you also please provide me with the version of iOS that is installed on your device? 

Customer: Sure, it's iOS 11.4.1 

Customer Service Agent: Perfect, thank you for providing that information. It looks like the issue may be due to compatibility issues between your device and our streaming services. In order to fix this issue, we recommend that you upgrade your device to iOS 12 or higher as this will ensure compatibility with our streaming services. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should do it. Thank you for all of your help!
