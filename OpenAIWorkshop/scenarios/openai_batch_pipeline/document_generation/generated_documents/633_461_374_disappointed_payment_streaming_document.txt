Hi there, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I have an issue. I recently signed up for the streaming product and my payment didn't go through. Can you help me?

Agent:
Hello, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you please provide me with your account information so that I can look into this for you?

Customer:
Sure, my account number is 1234-5678-9012. 

Agent: 
Thank you. I'm pulling up your account now and it looks like there is a problem with the payment information. It appears that the payment failed to process due to an issue with the credit card number you provided. Is this correct?

Customer: 
Yes, that's correct. Is there any way to fix this so I can keep my streaming subscription? 

Agent: 
Yes, absolutely! We can update the credit card information on your account so that we can process your payment. Do you have a new card that you'd like to use? 

Customer: 
Yes, I do. It's a Visa card with the number 4242-4242-4242-4242. 

Agent: 
Great! Let me just update the information on your account and then we'll be able to process your payment. Please give me one moment while I do that. 

Customer: 
Okay, no problem. 

Agent: 
All right, everything looks good on our end now! Your payment should process within the next few minutes and then your streaming subscription will be active again. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: 
No, thank you very much for your help! That's all for now.
