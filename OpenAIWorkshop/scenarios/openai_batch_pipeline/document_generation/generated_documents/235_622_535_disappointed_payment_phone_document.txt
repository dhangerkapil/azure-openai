Thank you for providing us with this information. We are now able to locate your account and look into the issue further. It appears that we have not received any payments from you since your initial purchase date. We do require all customers to make payments in installments for their purchases and failure to do so can result in late fees or even cancellation of the order.

I understand that, but I have not received any kind of notification or information regarding when I should make these payments or how much I owe. Can you please provide me with this information? 

Agent: 
Of course! We will be more than happy to provide you with this information. According to our records, your current balance is $xxx and it is due by June 4th. You will also receive an email notification regarding your balance and due date soon. 

Customer: 
I see, thank you for providing me with this information. Is there anything else that I need to know regarding my payments? 

Agent: 
Yes, if you are unable to make the payment by the due date, then please contact us as soon as possible so we can discuss other payment options available to you. We also want to remind our customers that all payments must be made in full before the product is shipped or delivered. If you have any other questions or concerns regarding your payment, please do not hesitate to contact us again and we will be more than happy to assist you further.
