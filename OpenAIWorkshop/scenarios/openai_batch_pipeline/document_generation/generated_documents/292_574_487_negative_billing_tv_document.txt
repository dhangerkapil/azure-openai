Customer: Hi, I'm having an issue with my bill and I'm hoping you can help. 

Customer Service Agent: Hi there! I'm glad you reached out to us about your bill. How can I help?

Customer: I recently purchased a TV from Contoso Wireless and it's not working properly. I've already tried troubleshooting it myself but nothing seems to be working. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience that this has caused you. We would be more than happy to help troubleshoot the issue. Can you please provide me with the model number of the TV so we can look into the matter further? 

Customer: The model number is 12345678. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for providing the model number. I'll take a look and see what I can do to help. Can you please tell me what kind of problems you are experiencing with the TV? 

Customer: The picture quality is poor and there's a lot of static noise when I turn it on. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, thank you for letting me know. We'll try our best to resolve this issue for you. In the meantime, we will be more than happy to provide you with a refund for the purchase of the TV if that is something you would like us to do. 

Customer: That would be great, thank you! Is there anything else I need to do in order to get the refund? 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, we will need you to return the TV back to us before we can process your refund. Please make sure to include all original packaging materials as well as any accessories that came with the TV when returning it back to us. Once we receive your return, we will process your refund as soon as possible. 

Customer: Alright, sounds good. Is there a way for me to track my return so I know when it's been received by Contoso Wireless? 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, once you have shipped your return back to us, we will send you an email with a tracking number so that you can track your package and know when it has been received by us. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should be all. Thank you so much for your help!
