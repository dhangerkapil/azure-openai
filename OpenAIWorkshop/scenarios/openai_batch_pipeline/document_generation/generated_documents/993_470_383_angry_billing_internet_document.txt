"I'm so fed up with Contoso Wireless! My internet isn't working and I've been billed for it! This is outrageous!"

Agent:
Hello, I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please provide me with your account information so that I can take a look into the issue?

Customer:
Yes, my account number is 12345678.

Agent: 
Thank you for providing your account information. I'm sorry to hear that your internet isn't working. Can you tell me what type of internet service you have?

Customer: 
I have the basic home internet package.

Agent: 
I understand. I'm sorry to hear that you are having trouble with your internet service. Let me take a look at your account to see if there are any billing issues that could be causing this problem. Please give me a few moments while I check this out.

Customer: 
Okay, thank you. I just want to get this fixed as soon as possible.

Agent: 
I understand, and I am doing my best to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. It looks like there was an error in the billing process, and you were accidentally charged for two months of service instead of one. I am refunding the difference back to your account immediately and updating the billing information. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: 
Yes, actually. Can you tell me what kind of speeds are included in the basic home internet package? 

Agent: 
Sure, the basic home internet package includes speeds of up to 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

 Customer: 
No, that's all for now. Thank you for helping me with this issue.
