Customer:  Hi, I'm looking to purchase a Contoso Wireless product but I have a few questions. 

Customer Service Agent: Hi there! Welcome to Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today? 

Customer: Sure, I was wondering if I can make payments on the product in installments. 

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! We offer installment plans on all of our products. How many months would you like to spread out your payments? 

Customer: That's great! I was thinking about six months. 

Customer Service Agent: Perfect. With our six-month installment plan, you'll be able to make payments on the product for six months with no interest added. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: Yes, can you tell me more about the product? What are its features and benefits? 

Customer Service Agent: Of course! Our product is a wireless router that offers fast speeds and reliable connection. It also has a range of up to 300 feet, so it can cover a large area with ease. Additionally, it has a built-in firewall for added security and protection from malware and viruses. Are there any other questions I can answer for you? 

Customer: That sounds great! One last thing - what is the return policy? 

Customer Service Agent: We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all our products. If you're not satisfied with your purchase, simply return it within 30 days for a full refund. Does that answer your question? 

Customer: Yes, that does - thank you very much for your help!
