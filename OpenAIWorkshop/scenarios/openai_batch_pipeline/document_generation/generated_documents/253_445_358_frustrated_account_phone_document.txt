Hello, I'm having a problem with my Contoso Wireless account. I recently purchased a new phone and I'm having trouble activating it. Can you help?

Agent:

Good afternoon, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble activating your new phone. We are here to help. Can you tell me what the exact issue is? 

Customer: 

Well, I have my Contoso Wireless account number, but when I try to enter it into the activation page, it says the account is invalid. 

Agent: 

I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take a look at your account and see if I can determine why it's not working. Could you please provide me with your account number? 

Customer: 

Yes, my account number is 1234-5678-9101-1121. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing me with your account number. I'm now looking into your account and seeing what the issue might be. In the meantime, can you tell me more about the phone that you're trying to activate? What type of phone is it? 

 Customer: 
It's a Contoso Wireless X-45 Smartphone. It was released last month and I just bought it yesterday. 

 Agent: 
Thank you for providing me with that information. It looks like there was a small glitch in our system when you tried to enter your account number and that's why it was rejected. I've now fixed the issue and you should be able to successfully activate your phone now. Please try again and let me know if there are any other problems or issues that I can help you with today.
