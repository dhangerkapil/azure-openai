Customer: 
"I just got my bill from Contoso Wireless and I'm not happy. I paid for a phone that I haven't even gotten yet. What's going on?"

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience, but I'll be happy to help you out. Can you please provide me with your account information so that I can look into this for you?"

Customer: 
"My account number is XXXXXX. Now, can you tell me when I'll be getting my phone?"

Agent: 
"Certainly. Let me just take a look at your account and see what I can find out. Please give me one moment." 

(A few moments later) 

Agent: 
"Thank you for your patience. It looks like there was a delay in processing your payment, which caused the delay in shipping your phone. I've gone ahead and expedited the process so that it will arrive within the next few days." 

Customer: 
"That's not good enough! I want to know why this happened in the first place and what is being done to prevent it from happening again." 

Agent: 
"Of course. We take these matters very seriously and we apologize for the inconvenience. We are looking into the issue and will take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. We value our customers and want to make sure they have a positive experience with us." 

Customer: 
"That's not enough! I should get something back for this hassle! What are you going to do to make this right?" 

Agent: 
"I understand your frustration and we want to make sure that this doesn't happen again. As a token of our apology, we would like to offer you a free month of service as well as a 10% discount on your next purchase." 

Customer: 
"That's more like it! I accept your offer, but please make sure this doesn't happen again." 

Agent: 
"Absolutely. We value our customers and appreciate your feedback. We are taking steps to ensure that this doesn't happen again and we thank you for your patience and understanding."
