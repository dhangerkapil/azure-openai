Customer:
"I purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and the service is terrible. I can't even make a call without the line dropping. What can you do to help?"

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience you are experiencing. We understand how important it is to have a working phone and we want to help you get your issue resolved as soon as possible. Can you tell me a little bit more about what's happening with your phone?"

Customer: 
"It's been acting up since I got it. I can't make a call without it dropping the line and I've had to restart it several times. I've already tried troubleshooting it but nothing seems to be working."

Agent: 
"We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. We'd like to offer you a free replacement phone for the one that you have now, so that you can continue using your service without any further issues. Would that be okay with you?"

Customer: 
"Yes, that would be great. Can you tell me how long it will take for me to get the new phone?"

Agent: 
"We can have the new phone sent out to you within two business days. Is there anything else we can do for you in the meantime?"

Customer: 
"No, that should be all. Thanks for your help."

Agent: 
"You're welcome! We'll get that new phone sent out right away and if there's anything else we can do for you, please don't hesitate to let us know."
