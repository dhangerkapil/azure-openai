Hi there, I recently subscribed to Contoso Wireless and I'm trying to figure out how to downgrade my streaming service. Can you help me?

Agent:

Hello! It's great to hear from you. We are here to help with any questions or concerns you may have. Can you tell me more about the streaming service you're looking to downgrade?

Sure. I have the premium streaming package and I'd like to downgrade to the basic package. Is that something I can do?

That sounds great! Can I get a refund for the premium package if I downgrade?

Customer: 
Ok, that's fine. I just wanted to make sure. Is there anything else I need to know about downgrading my streaming service?
