"Hi, I'm having trouble understanding Contoso Wireless' upgrade services. I purchased a new TV from you recently and I'm not sure how to upgrade it. Can you help me?"

Agent: 
"Hello there! Thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. We're more than happy to help you understand our upgrade services. Could you please provide me with some more information about your purchase?"

Customer:
"Yes, of course. I bought a 55-inch LED Smart TV from Contoso Wireless about a month ago. Is there a way I can upgrade it?"

Agent: 
"Yes, there are several ways to upgrade your TV depending on what features you would like to add. Could you tell me what type of upgrades you're interested in?"

Customer: 
"Well, I'd like to be able to access streaming services on my TV, like Netflix and Hulu. Is that possible?"

Agent: 
"Absolutely! We have several options for upgrading your TV so that it can access streaming services. Would you like me to explain the different options available to you?"

Customer: 
"Yes, please. That would be great." 

Agent: 
"Sure! There are several ways to upgrade your TV so that it can access streaming services. You can either purchase an external streaming device, such as a Roku or Apple TV, which will allow you to access streaming services directly on your TV. Alternatively, you could purchase a Smart TV adapter, which will enable your existing TV to access streaming services without the need for additional hardware. Finally, if your TV has an HDMI port, you can purchase an HDMI streaming device, such as the Google Chromecast or Amazon Fire Stick, which will allow you to access streaming services on your TV." 

Customer: 
"That's really helpful. Which option do you think is best for me?" 

Agent: 
"That really depends on your budget and what features you're looking for. The external streaming device option offers the most flexibility in terms of what types of services are available, but it is also the most expensive option. The Smart TV adapter and HDMI streaming device options are both less expensive and offer similar features, but may not have access to as many streaming services as the external device option."
