Customer: Hello, I'm looking for some help with my billing.

Agent: Hi, how can I help you today?

Customer: I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless TV and I'm having some issues with the billing. Can you help me out?

Agent: Absolutely! Can you tell me a bit more about what's going on?

Customer: Well, when I bought the TV I was told that I would be able to get a discount if I paid in full, but now when I check my bill it doesn't seem like the discount has been applied.

Agent: That does sound like an issue. Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on. Can I get your account number?

Customer: Sure, it's [Account Number]. 

Agent: Thanks for that. I'm looking into it now and it looks like the discount wasn't applied to your account. It looks like there was an issue with the system when you purchased the TV and we apologize for the inconvenience. We can definitely apply the discount to your account now and make sure that you get the savings you were expecting. 

Customer: That would be great! 

Agent: Absolutely! We'll go ahead and apply the discount to your account right away. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should do it. Thank you for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can do for you? 

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks again! 

Agent: You're very welcome! Have a great day!
