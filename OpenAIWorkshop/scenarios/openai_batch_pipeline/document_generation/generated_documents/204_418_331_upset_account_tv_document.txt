Hello, this is [Name] from Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer:
I'm having a problem with my account. I bought a new TV but it won't connect to the network.

Customer Service Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please provide me with some details about your account?

Customer: 
Yes, my account number is 1234-5678 and I purchased the TV two days ago. 

Customer Service Agent:
Thank you for providing me with the information. Can you tell me what type of TV you purchased? 

Customer: 
I purchased a 55-inch OLED Smart TV. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Thank you for that information. Could you please provide me with the serial number of your TV? 

Customer: 
Yes, it's XXXXXXX. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Thank you for that information. I'll need to look into this further and try to determine why the TV is not connecting to the network. Could you please give me a few minutes while I investigate further? 

Customer: 
Yes, of course. Thank you. 

 Customer Service Agent: 
No problem at all. I have looked into this further and it appears that the problem may be due to an incorrect setting on the TV itself. I suggest that you try changing the settings to see if that resolves the issue. If that does not work, please let me know and we can look into other potential solutions.
