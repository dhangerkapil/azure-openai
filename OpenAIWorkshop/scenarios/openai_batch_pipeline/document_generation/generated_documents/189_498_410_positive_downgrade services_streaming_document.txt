Customer: Hi, I'm looking for some information about Contoso Wireless's streaming service. 

Agent: Hi there! I'm happy to help you with any questions you may have about our streaming service. How can I help you? 

Customer: I'm interested in learning more about the downgrade options for the streaming service. Can you tell me more about that? 

Agent: Absolutely! Contoso Wireless offers two downgrade options for our streaming service. The first option is a basic downgrade, which reduces your data plan to the lowest available level. The second option is a premium downgrade, which reduces your data plan but still provides access to our streaming library. 

Customer: What kind of streaming library do you offer with the premium downgrade option? 

Agent: With the premium downgrade option, you will have access to our full library of movies and TV shows. We also offer music streaming with this plan. You'll have access to thousands of songs, as well as exclusive playlists and artist channels. 

Customer: That sounds great! Is there a cost associated with the premium downgrade option? 

Agent: Yes, there is an additional cost associated with the premium downgrade option. The cost will depend on your current data plan and usage levels, but it will be clearly outlined in your billing statement when you make the change. 

Customer: Is there anything else I should know before I decide to downgrade my service? 

Agent: Yes, it's important to note that downgrading your service may result in reduced speed or limited access to certain features. Additionally, if you decide to upgrade your service again at a later date, you may incur additional fees or charges. It's always best to consult with our customer service team before making any changes to your account. 

Customer: That makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to explain this to me! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
