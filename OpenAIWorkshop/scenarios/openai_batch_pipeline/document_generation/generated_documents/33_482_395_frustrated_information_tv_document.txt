Hi, I'm trying to find out some information about the Contoso Wireless TV. Can you help me?

Agent:

Hello there! Absolutely, I'm here to help. What information are you looking for? 

Customer: 

Well, I'm wondering if the TV is compatible with other Contoso Wireless devices and what the features are. 

Agent: 

Of course! The Contoso Wireless TV is compatible with all of our other devices and comes with some great features. It has an HD display, a built-in Wi-Fi connection, and access to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. 

Customer: 

That sounds great, but I'm also wondering about the cost. How much does the TV cost? 

Agent: 

The Contoso Wireless TV costs $500 plus taxes and shipping. Does that sound okay? 

Customer: 

That's a bit more than I was expecting. Is there any way you can lower the price or offer any special discounts? 

Agent: 
I understand your concern. We do offer a few different discounts for our customers. If you purchase the Contoso Wireless TV in a bundle with one of our other devices, you will receive a 10% discount on the entire purchase. Additionally, if you purchase through our online store, we offer free shipping and a 5% discount on all orders over $250. Does that sound like something that could work for you? 

Customer: 
Yes, those sound like good options. Can I also get an extended warranty with my purchase? 

Agent: 
Absolutely! We offer an extended warranty plan on all of our products for an additional fee. The plan includes coverage for up to two years on all parts and labor associated with the device. Is this something you would like to add to your purchase?
