Agent: Hi there! I apologize for the inconvenience you're having. We want to make sure you have the best experience possible with our services. Could you please explain the issue in more detail?

Customer: Sure. Whenever I try to stream a movie or TV show, it takes forever to load. I've waited up to 20 minutes and nothing happens. I've tried restarting the app and my device, but nothing seems to work. 

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. I understand your frustration and we'll do our best to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Can you tell me what type of device you're using and what version of the streaming app you have installed? 

Customer: Yes, I'm using an iPhone 8 Plus and I have the latest version of the app installed. 

Agent: Alright, great. Let me take a look into this for you and see what I can find out. In the meantime, could you please provide me with your account number so that I can verify your information? 

Customer: Sure, my account number is 456-890-123. 

Agent: Perfect, thank you for that information. Give me just a few moments while I look into this further for you. 

[Agent takes a few moments to investigate] 

Agent: Okay, it looks like the issue might be due to an outdated version of the streaming app on your device. The latest version should resolve this issue for you. Could you please update your app and let me know if that resolves the issue? 

Customer: Yeah, sure thing! I'll give it a try and let you know if it works. 

[Customer updates the app] 

Customer: Alright, it looks like that worked! Thanks so much for helping me out with this issue. 

Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
