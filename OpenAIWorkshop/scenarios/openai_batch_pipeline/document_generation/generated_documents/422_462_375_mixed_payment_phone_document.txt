Customer Service Agent: Absolutely, I can help you with that. What would you like to know? 

Customer: Well, first off, what kind of payment methods do you accept?

Customer: Okay great. What about payment plans? Do you offer any? 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, we do offer payment plans for our customers. You can choose from a range of payment plans depending on the phone you are purchasing. 

Customer: That's really helpful. So how does it work? 

Customer Service Agent: Our payment plans are based on a fixed monthly fee that is spread over a certain period of time. Depending on the phone you choose, the amount of the monthly fee and length of the payment plan will vary.
