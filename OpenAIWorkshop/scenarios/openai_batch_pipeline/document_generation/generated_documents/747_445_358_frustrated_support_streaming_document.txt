"Hi, I'm having trouble streaming with your product. It keeps freezing and won't play properly."

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience you're experiencing. Can you tell me more about the issue? Are you having trouble with a particular program or video?"

Customer: 
"I've been trying to watch a movie but it won't play. I can get it to start but then it freezes up after a few minutes. It's really frustrating."

Agent: 
"I understand how that can be annoying. Can you tell me what type of device you're using and what type of connection you're using? That information will help us determine the issue."

Customer: 
"I'm using an iPhone 8 and my internet connection is strong. I've had no other issues with streaming video on other sites."

Agent: 
"That's good to know. We'll look into this further and see if we can figure out what the issue is. In the meantime, can you try rebooting your device and see if that helps?"

Customer: 
"I've already done that multiple times. It hasn't worked." 

Agent: 
"Alright, let me take a closer look at this. Could you please provide me with some additional information such as your device model number, software version, and operating system?" 

Customer: 
"Sure, here's all the info you need. Please hurry, I really need to watch this movie!" 

Agent: 
"Of course, I understand. I'll get right to work on this and get back to you as soon as possible with an update on our progress."
