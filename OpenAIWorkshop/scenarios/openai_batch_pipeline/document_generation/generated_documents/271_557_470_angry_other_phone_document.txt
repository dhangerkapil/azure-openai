Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that your phone isn't working. Can you tell me what's happening?

Customer: Well, it won't even turn on! I just got it and it was working for a few minutes and then it died.

Agent: That doesn't sound right. Can you tell me which model of phone you purchased?

Customer: It's the Contoso Vibe 5G. I just bought it yesterday and now it won't turn on at all.

Agent: Ok, let's see if we can get this sorted out. First, can you tell me what steps you took when the phone stopped working?

Customer: I tried turning it off and back on again but nothing happened. I also tried removing the battery and putting it back in but still nothing. 

Agent: Alright, that's good to know. Let's try a few other things to see if we can get this sorted out. First, let's try resetting the phone. To do this, hold down the power button and the volume down button for 10 seconds and then release them both. This should reset the phone to its factory settings and hopefully get it working again. 

Customer: Alright, I'll try that.

Customer: It didn't work! Now what? 

Agent: Hmm, that's strange. Let's try one more thing before we move on to our next option. Could you plug your phone into a power source with the USB cable that came with your phone? 

Customer: Sure, I'll give that a try.

Customer: It worked! The phone is now turning on and seems to be functioning normally. 

Agent: Great news! I'm glad we were able to get your phone up and running again. If you have any other issues or questions about your Contoso Vibe 5G please don't hesitate to reach out to us again. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, thank you for your help!
