Hello, I am very unhappy with Contoso Wireless' upgrade services. I recently tried to upgrade my phone and the process was so slow and inefficient. It took me two weeks just to get a response from customer service, and when I finally did, it was so unhelpful. Can you tell me what other products Contoso Wireless offers?
