Agent: Hi there, I apologize for any dissatisfaction you have experienced with our product. Can you tell me more about the issue you are having?

Customer: Well, the phone has been constantly freezing and lagging when I use it. I'm afraid it will eventually stop working altogether.

Agent: That doesn't sound good at all. We want to make sure that our customers are satisfied with our products and services. What type of phone did you purchase?

Customer: It's the Contoso Wireless Smartphone.

Agent: Okay, let me look into this for you. Can you please provide me with the model number of your device?

Customer: Sure, it's model CW-3345.

Agent: Thank you for that information. Please give me one moment while I investigate further into your issue.

Agent: Alright, I've looked into this and found that this model of phone is known to have issues with freezing and lagging after extended use. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and would like to offer you a full refund for the phone. Would that be acceptable? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great. But what about my data? All of my contacts and photos are stored on the phone and I don't want to lose them when I return it. 

Agent: No problem! We can transfer your data from the current device to a new one free of charge, if you'd like to purchase a different model from us. 

Customer: That sounds great! Are there any other options that might be better suited to my needs?
