Customer Service Agent:

Welcome to Contoso Wireless, this is [name], how may I help you? 

Customer:

I'm having a problem with my account and I'm getting really frustrated. What's going on? 

Customer Service Agent:

I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me a little more about what's going on? 

Customer: 

I just logged into my account and noticed that my monthly payment for the product I purchased was higher than usual. I'd like to know why that is. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I understand that you're concerned about the increased payment. Could you provide me with your account number so that I can take a look at your account and see what's going on? 

Customer: 

Sure, here's my account number. [Account Number] 

Customer Service Agent: 

Thank you for providing me with your account number. After reviewing your account, I noticed that you recently upgraded your product to a higher tier, which resulted in an increase in the monthly payment. Is this correct? 

 Customer: 
Yes, that is correct. However, I don't remember being informed of the increased payment when I upgraded my product. Can you tell me why I wasn't made aware of this? 

 Customer Service Agent: 
I apologize for any confusion regarding the increased payment. When you upgraded your product, we automatically applied a discount to the new tier which reduced the overall price of the product. We failed to notify you of this change in payment because of the discount, but we should have made you aware of it. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
