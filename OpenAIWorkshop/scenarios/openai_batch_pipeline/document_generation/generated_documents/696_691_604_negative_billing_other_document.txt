Customer: Hi, I'm having some issues with my billing and I need help understanding why I'm being charged so much.

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please provide me with some more information so that I can assist you better?

Customer: Sure. I just received my latest bill and it's much higher than it should be. It's almost double what I was expecting.

Customer Service Agent: Okay, let me take a look at your account. Can you provide me with your account number? 

Customer: Sure, it's [Account Number]. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for providing me with the necessary information. Let me take a look at your account and see what is going on. Please give me one moment while I check on this for you. 

Customer: Okay, thanks. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, I've taken a look at your account and it looks like the higher charge is due to an additional product that was added to your plan recently. Is this something that you authorized? 

Customer: No, I did not authorize any additional products to be added to my plan. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let me look into this further and see if we can get this sorted out for you. Can you provide me with the details of the product that was added to your plan? 

Customer: Yes, it's a new phone model called the Contoso Pixel 3XL. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for providing me with the details of the product. Let me take a look into this further and see if we can resolve this issue for you. Please give me one moment while I investigate this further. 

Customer: Alright, thanks. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, after looking into this further, it looks like the additional charge is due to a promotional offer that was applied to your account when you purchased the Contoso Pixel 3XL phone model. The promotional offer includes an additional data plan which is why there is an additional charge on your bill. Does this make sense? 

Customer: So basically I'm being charged extra because of some kind of promotion that was automatically applied to my account without my knowledge? That doesn't seem fair at all! 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this issue. We understand how frustrating this must be for you and we are committed to providing our customers with the best possible service experience. We would like to offer you a one-time credit of $50 as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience caused by this issue. Does that sound fair? 

 Customer: Yes, that sounds fair. Thank you for resolving my issue and offering such a generous credit!
