Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble with my phone and I need to speak with someone about downgrading my service. 

Agent: Hello, thank you for reaching out to Contoso Wireless. My name is [Name], and I'm here to help you. What seems to be the issue with your phone? 

Customer: I'm having a lot of problems with it. It's slow, it won't charge, and the apps don't work properly. 

Agent: I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Can you please provide me with your account number so I can look into this further? 

Customer: Sure, it's [account number]. 

Agent: Thank you for that information. Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on. Please give me one moment while I do that. 

(pause) 

Agent: Okay, I see that your phone is running an outdated version of our software which is causing some of the issues you're having. To get your phone working properly again, we can downgrade your service plan and give you access to the new software. Is this something you would be interested in? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great! What do I need to do? 

Agent: All you need to do is call our customer service line at [phone number] and speak with one of our representatives about downgrading your plan. They will be able to walk you through the process and get everything set up for you. 

Customer: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you for all your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should do it. Thanks again!
