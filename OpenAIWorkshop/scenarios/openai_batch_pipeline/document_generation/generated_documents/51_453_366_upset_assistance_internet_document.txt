Hello, this is [name], a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How may I help you today? 

Customer: 
I'm having a terrible time with your internet service. It's been down for hours and I need it to work!

Customer Service Agent: 
I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. Can you please provide me with some more information? Are you having trouble connecting to the internet, or is the speed slow? 

Customer: 
The connection won't stay up for more than a few minutes. It's really frustrating. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand. Have you tried restarting your modem and router? This can sometimes help to resolve connectivity issues. 

Customer: 
Yes, I've tried that multiple times. It doesn't seem to be working. 

Customer Service Agent: 
In that case, I'd suggest that you contact your ISP directly to see if they can provide any additional assistance. We may need to look into the possibility of a faulty modem or router as well. In the meantime, I can try to help you troubleshoot further if you'd like. 

Customer: 
Yes, that would be great! What else can I do? 

Customer Service Agent: 
First, let's try resetting your modem and router again, just in case that helps to resolve the issue. If that doesn't work, then we can look into possible conflicts between your devices and the network. You can also check for any updates to your operating system and wireless drivers on your computer or device. Finally, you can try connecting directly to the modem with an ethernet cable and see if that helps at all.
