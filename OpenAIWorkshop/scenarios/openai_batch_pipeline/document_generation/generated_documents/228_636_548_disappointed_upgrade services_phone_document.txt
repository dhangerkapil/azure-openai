Hello there! Thanks for considering Contoso Wireless for your upgrade needs. The product phone we offer is the latest model from our flagship line of phones. It comes with an impressive array of features, including a large screen, high-speed processor, and top-of-the-line camera. It's also compatible with our latest network technology, so you can get the most out of your connection. 

Customer:
That sounds great! But I'm concerned about the cost. Is there any way to get a better deal?

Of course! We offer several different plans and packages to choose from. Depending on your needs, we can find something that fits your budget.  We also have discounts available for customers who sign up for multiple lines or who bundle their services. 

Customer:
That's good to know. But what about the phone itself? Does it come with a warranty? 

Agent:
Yes, the product phone comes with a one year warranty that covers any manufacturer defects or issues with the device itself.  You can also purchase an extended warranty if you want additional coverage beyond the one year period.

Customer: 
That sounds great! One last question - how long does it take to receive my new phone after I order it? 

Agent: 
It typically takes 2-3 business days for orders to arrive, but in some cases it can be quicker depending on where you're located and which shipping method you choose at checkout. We also offer expedited shipping options if you need your device sooner than that.
