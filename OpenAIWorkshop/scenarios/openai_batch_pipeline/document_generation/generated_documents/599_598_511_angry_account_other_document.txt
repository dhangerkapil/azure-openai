Agent: "Hello, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you please tell me more about the issue you're experiencing? What product are you trying to add?"

Customer: "I'm trying to add an extra data plan to my account, but it keeps telling me there's an error."

Agent: "I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please tell me your account number so I can take a closer look at what might be causing the issue?"

Customer: "It's [account number]. Please tell me what's wrong."

Agent: "Thank you for providing your account number. I'm seeing that there is an issue with the billing address associated with your account. It appears that the address is incorrect and needs to be updated before we can add the product."

Customer: "That doesn't make any sense! I've had this address for years and never had any problems before. Why is it suddenly an issue now?"

Agent: "I understand your frustration. It appears that our system has recently updated and is now requiring all billing addresses to be verified before any changes can be made. That includes adding new products." 

Customer: "This is ridiculous! Why didn't anyone tell me this before now? I've been trying to add this product for days!" 

Agent: "Again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We should have been clearer about this policy change when it happened. Would you like help updating your billing address so we can proceed with adding the product to your account?" 

Customer: "Yes, please. I just want this taken care of as soon as possible." 

Agent: "Of course. Can you please provide me with your updated billing address so I can update it in our system?" 

Customer: "Sure, it's [updated billing address]. Please make sure this is taken care of quickly." 

Agent: "Absolutely. I've gone ahead and updated the address in our system and we should be able to add the extra data plan to your account now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?" 

Customer: "No, that should do it. Thank you for your help." 

Agent: "You're welcome! Have a great day!"
