Customer: 
"Hello, I'm looking for some help with streaming on my Contoso Wireless product. Is this something you can help me with?"

Agent: 
"Yes, absolutely! We're here to help you with any questions you may have about streaming on your Contoso Wireless product. Could you tell me a bit more about the issue you're having?"

Customer: 
"I'm trying to stream a movie on my device but it's not working. I've tried restarting the device but that didn't seem to help."

Agent: 
"I understand. Can you tell me what device you're using and what version of the Contoso Wireless software you have installed?"

Customer: 
"I'm using an iPhone 8 and I have the latest version of the Contoso Wireless software installed."

Agent: 
"Ok, great. Let's try a few things to get your streaming working. First, can you make sure that your Wi-Fi connection is strong? It might be worth connecting to a different network if possible."

Customer: 
"I'm connected to my home Wi-Fi network and the signal is strong. What else can I try?"

Agent: 
"We should also check that your device has enough free storage space available for streaming. Can you check this for me?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I have over 10 GB of free space available. What else can I do?" 

Agent: 
"The next step would be to check that all of your streaming apps are up to date. Can you take a look at this for me?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, all of my apps are up to date. Is there anything else I can try?" 

Agent: 
"The last step would be to try restarting your device again and then trying to stream the movie again. Does this sound like something you'd be able to do?" 

Customer: 
"Yes, I can do that. Thank you for your help." 

Agent: 
"You're welcome! Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you."
