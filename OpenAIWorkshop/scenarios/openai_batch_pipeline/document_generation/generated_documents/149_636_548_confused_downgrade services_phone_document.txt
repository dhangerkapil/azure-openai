Customer Service Agent: Hi there, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi, I just bought a phone from your company and I'm a bit confused about the downgrade service. Can you explain it to me?

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely. Downgrade services allow you to switch to a lower tier phone plan without having to pay the full price of a new phone. You'll just have to pay the difference between your current plan and the new one. Is that what you're looking for?

Customer: Yes, that's exactly it. But how do I know which plan is best for me?

Customer Service Agent: That really depends on your needs. Do you have an idea of what kind of phone you would like to use? We can discuss different plans based on that. 

Customer: Well, I was thinking of getting a Samsung Galaxy S20. 

Customer Service Agent: Great choice! We have several plans available for the S20 that will fit your needs. Do you want me to explain each one in detail or would you prefer to go over them on our website? 

Customer: Could you explain them briefly over the phone so I can get an idea of which one might be right for me? 

Customer Service Agent: Sure, no problem! The first plan is our basic plan which offers unlimited minutes, texts and data with no monthly fee. The second plan is our mid-tier plan which offers more data and additional features such as hotspot access and international roaming for an additional fee. The third plan is our premium plan which offers unlimited minutes, texts and data with additional features such as mobile hotspot access and international roaming for a higher monthly fee. 

Customer: That's helpful. Can you tell me more about the differences between the plans? 

Customer Service Agent: Sure thing! The basic plan is best for those who don't need extra features or data usage, while the mid-tier plan is best for those who need more data or want access to extra features such as mobile hotspot access or international roaming. The premium plan is best for those who need even more data or want access to all the features available with our service. 

Customer: That makes sense. Which one do you think would be best for me? 

Customer Service Agent: It really depends on your usage habits and needs. If you're not sure which one would be best, we suggest starting with the basic plan and then upgrading if necessary. We also offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you find that it's not the right fit for you.
