Hello, I am not happy with the internet service I have been receiving from Contoso Wireless. It has been really slow and unreliable. Can you tell me what I can do to downgrade my service?

Agent:

Hello there, thank you for reaching out to us about your internet service. I apologize for the inconvenience that you have experienced. We do offer downgrade options depending on your current plan and what type of speeds you are looking for. Can you tell me more about your current plan and what speeds you are looking for? 

Customer: 

Yes, I currently have the "Unlimited Plus" plan, and I would like to downgrade to the "Basic" plan. What are the differences between the two plans in terms of speed and data usage? 

Agent: 

The Unlimited Plus plan offers download speeds up to 75 Mbps and upload speeds up to 25 Mbps with unlimited data usage. The Basic plan offers download speeds up to 10 Mbps and upload speeds up to 2 Mbps with a data usage limit of 250GB per month. 

Customer: 

That's a huge difference in speed and data usage! Are there any other options that might be a better fit for my needs? 

Agent: 
Yes, we do offer a few other plans that may be more suitable for your needs. We have the "Unlimited Pro" plan which offers download speeds up to 150 Mbps and upload speeds up to 50 Mbps with unlimited data usage; as well as the "Essential" plan which offers download speeds up to 25 Mbps and upload speeds up to 5 Mbps with a data usage limit of 500GB per month. Which of these plans would you like to learn more about? 

Customer: 
I think the Essential plan sounds like it might be a better fit for me. Could you tell me more about this plan?
