Agent: Absolutely! What seems to be the problem? 

Customer: Well, I recently purchased a new TV and I'm trying to set it up with my Contoso Wireless account, but I can't seem to get it to work. 

Agent: No problem. Let's take a look and see what's going on. Is your TV connected to your Contoso Wireless account? 

Customer: Yes, it is. I've already gone through the setup process, but when I try to access my account on the TV, it says that there is an authentication error. 

Agent: That's strange. Can you tell me exactly what you've done so far? 

Customer: Sure. I went through the setup process and entered my Contoso Wireless username and password into the TV. But when I try to access my account, it says there is an authentication error. 

Agent: Hmm...It sounds like there might be an issue with your username or password. Have you tried resetting your password? 

Customer: No, I haven't. How do I do that? 

Agent: Not a problem. You can reset your password by visiting our website and clicking on the 'Forgot Password' link at the bottom of the page. Once you enter your username and answer a few security questions, you'll be able to create a new password for your account. 

Customer: Ok, got it. Thanks for the help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can do for you today?
