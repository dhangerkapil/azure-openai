Customer: Hi, I'm looking for some information about Contoso Wireless's internet service.

Agent: Hi there! I'm glad you've reached out to us. We are always happy to provide information about our products and services. What would you like to know about our internet service?

Customer: I was hoping to find out what speeds are available, as well as any additional fees or services that come with it.

Agent: Sure! We have a variety of speeds available, ranging from 10Mbps up to 500Mbps. The exact speed will depend on your location and the plan you choose. As far as fees go, there may be installation and/or activation fees, depending on your plan. We also offer additional services such as virus protection and parental control for an extra fee.

Customer: That sounds great. What kind of contracts do you offer?

Agent: We offer both month-to-month and annual contracts for our internet service. With the month-to-month contract, you can cancel at any time without penalty. With the annual contract, you get a discounted rate but must commit to the full year of service. 

Customer: Are there any discounts available for new customers?

Agent: Yes! We offer a special promotion for new customers that includes a discounted rate for the first three months of service. After that, the rate will go back up to normal pricing. 

Customer: That sounds like a great deal! Is there anything else I need to know before signing up? 

Agent: Yes, we do require a credit check before we can activate your service. Additionally, you may need to purchase or rent equipment such as modems and routers in order to get online with our service. 

Customer: Alright, that makes sense. Is there anything else I should be aware of before signing up? 

Agent: Not that I can think of right now! If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out again at any time and we'd be happy to help out!
