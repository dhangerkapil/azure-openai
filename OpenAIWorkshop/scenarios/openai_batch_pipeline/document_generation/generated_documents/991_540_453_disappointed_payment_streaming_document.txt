Agent: Alright, it looks like your payment was rejected due to insufficient funds in your account. Do you have another payment method that we could use? 

Customer: Yes, I do have another card that I can use to make the payment. 

Agent: Great! Let me process that for you right away. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: Yes, actually. Can you explain to me how the streaming product works? 

Agent: Absolutely! The streaming product allows you to access all of our services without having to pay a monthly fee. You simply pay as you go and get access to our content library at no extra cost! 

Customer: That sounds great! Is there any way to get a discount on the streaming product? 

Agent: Unfortunately, we don't offer any discounts on the streaming product at this time, however, we do occasionally run promotional offers and discounts for our customers which you can take advantage of when they become available. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thanks for your help!
