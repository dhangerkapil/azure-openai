Hello, this is [Name], customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer:

I just bought one of your phones and it's not working properly. I'm really upset about this. 

Customer Service Agent:

I apologize for the inconvenience. What kind of phone did you purchase?

Customer:

It's the Contoso Wireless phone model X-2000. I've only had it for a few days and it keeps crashing and freezing up. 

Customer Service Agent:

I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's happening? Is it happening with all of your applications or just certain ones? 

Customer: 
Yes, it's happening with all of my applications. It will freeze up or crash and then I have to restart it, which is a huge pain. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand how frustrating that can be. Can you tell me if you have any other devices connected to your phone, like Bluetooth headsets or other accessories? 

Customer: 
No, I don't have any other devices connected to my phone. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Ok, thank you for the information. We'll take a look at your phone and see if we can figure out what's causing the issue. In the meantime, we can provide you with a loaner phone while we investigate the issue with yours. Would that be alright with you? 

Customer: 
Yes, that would be great! Thank you for understanding and helping me out with this problem. 

 Customer Service Agent: 
No problem at all! We'll get your loaner phone set up and shipped out to you as soon as possible so that you don't miss out on any calls or messages. If there is anything else I can help you with today, please let me know.
