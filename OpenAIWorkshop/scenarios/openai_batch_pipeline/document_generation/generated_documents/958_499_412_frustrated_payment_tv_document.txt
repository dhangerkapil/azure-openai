Agent: Alright, thank you for your patience. After looking into this, it appears that there is an issue with your credit card information that is preventing the payment from going through. We will need to update your credit card information in order to process the payment successfully. Would you like me to walk you through updating your credit card information now? 

Customer: Yes, please. That would be great. 

Agent: Okay, great. First, we will need to access your account on our website and then navigate to the Payment Information section. Once there, you can enter in your updated credit card information and submit it for processing. Does that sound okay? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds fine. 

Agent: Great! Once you have done that, please give us about 10 minutes for the payment to go through and then you should be able to make your purchase of the Contoso Wireless TV without any further issues. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, thank you very much for your help!
