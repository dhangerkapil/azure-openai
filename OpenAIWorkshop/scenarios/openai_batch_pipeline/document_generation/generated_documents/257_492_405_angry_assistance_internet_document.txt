Customer: Hi. I've been having trouble with my internet service lately and I need some help. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please provide me with a bit more information about the issue you're experiencing?

Customer: Sure. I've been trying to use my internet but it's been really slow and it keeps disconnecting randomly.

Customer Service Agent: I see. Have you tried restarting your router? That's often a quick fix for internet issues. 

Customer: Yes, I've already done that several times and it hasn't made any difference. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, then let's take a look at your account and see what we can do to get this sorted out. Can I get your account number please? 

Customer: Sure, it's 0123456789. 

Customer Service Agent: Great, thank you. I'm just looking up your account now... Could you please tell me what type of internet connection you have? 

Customer: I have the Contoso Wireless Fibre 500 Mbps connection. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, thank you for the information. It looks like there is an issue with your connection that needs to be fixed on our end. We will have a technician sent out to your address to take a look at the issue and get it fixed as soon as possible. 

Customer: That would be great, thank you! When do you think the technician will be able to come out? 

Customer Service Agent: The technician should be able to come out in the next 24-48 hours. We will send you an email confirming the appointment when it has been scheduled.  Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for your help!
