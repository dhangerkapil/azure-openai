Customer: Hello, I am a customer of Contoso Wireless and I am looking for assistance.

Agent: Hi there, how can I help you today?

Customer: I recently purchased a new product from your company, but it is not working as expected. Is there something you can do to help me?

Agent: Certainly! Can you tell me more about the issue you're having with the product?

Customer: Yes, I'm having trouble setting up the product. The instructions don't make sense and I'm having trouble getting it to work properly. 

Agent: I apologize for any confusion. Let me see if I can help. What specific steps have you taken so far in trying to set up the product?

Customer: Well, I've followed all the steps in the manual and tried connecting it to my computer but it still won't work. 

Agent: Alright, let's try a few other troubleshooting steps. First, let's check the connections and make sure everything is securely connected to your computer. Can you confirm that everything is connected correctly? 

Customer: Yes, everything is connected properly and securely. 

Agent: Great! Now let's try rebooting the device. This will reset all of its settings and hopefully resolve the issue you're having. Can you please reboot the device and then try connecting again? 

Customer: Sure, I'll give it a try. 

Agent: Perfect! Once you've done that, please let me know how it goes and if you're still having any issues with the product. 

Customer: Okay, I'll do that. Thanks for your help.
