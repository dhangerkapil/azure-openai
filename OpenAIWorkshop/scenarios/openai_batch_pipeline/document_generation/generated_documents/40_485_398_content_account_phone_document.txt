Customer: Hi, I have a question about the product phone I recently purchased from Contoso Wireless.

Agent: Hi there! My name is [Name], and I'm a customer service representative for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you with your product phone?

Customer: Well, I just received it and I noticed that the features don't match what was listed on the website. Can you tell me why that is?

Agent: Absolutely! We apologize for any confusion. We recently updated our website with new features and information on our product phones. It's possible that the phone you purchased didn't reflect the most recent update. Is there something specific you were looking for that isn't included in the phone?

Customer: Yes, I was looking for a feature that allows me to make international calls. Is this something that's available with this phone?

Agent: Yes, absolutely! This phone has an international calling feature that you can access by dialing *01 followed by the country code of the country you're trying to call. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your product phone? 

Customer: Yes, actually. I noticed when I signed up for my account with Contoso Wireless, there was an option to add additional lines. What are the benefits of adding additional lines to my account? 

Agent: Adding additional lines to your account is a great way to get the most out of your Contoso Wireless experience. With additional lines, you can share data and plan benefits across all devices connected to your account. You can also set individual data limits for each line on your account and receive discounts on monthly plan fees when adding multiple lines. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thanks for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Thank you for choosing Contoso Wireless. Have a great day!
