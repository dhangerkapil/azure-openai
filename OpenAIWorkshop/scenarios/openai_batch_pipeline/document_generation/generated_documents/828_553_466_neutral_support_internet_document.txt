Agent: Hi there, my name is [Name], and I'm a customer service representative for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you?

Customer: Yes, I was hoping you could help me with my internet service. I'm having trouble connecting to the internet.

Agent: Sure, I'll be happy to help you out. What kind of device are you using to connect to the internet?

Customer: It's a laptop that's running Windows 10.

Agent: Okay, let's take a look at your settings. Can you open up your network settings and tell me what type of connection you have selected?

Customer: Sure, it says it's connected to a Wi-Fi network called Contoso Wireless.

Agent: Alright, it looks like you are connected to our network. Can you try opening up a web browser and seeing if you can access the internet? 

Customer: I just tried that and it still isn't working. 

Agent: That's strange. Let me take a look at your account and see if there are any issues with your subscription. Can you give me your account information so I can check? 

Customer: Sure, my account number is [number]. 

Agent: Great, thanks for providing that information. It looks like your account is in good standing and there are no issues with your subscription. Are you using any antivirus or firewall software on your computer? 

Customer: Yes, I'm using Norton Security Suite. 

Agent: Okay, let's try disabling the firewall and see if that helps. Can you open up the Norton Security Suite application and disable the firewall? 

Customer: Sure, I just did that. 

Agent: Great, now try opening up a web browser again and see if you can access the internet this time. 

Customer: It looks like it's working now! Thank you so much for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! If you have any other questions or need any other assistance please don't hesitate to contact us again. Have a great day!
