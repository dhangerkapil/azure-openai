Agent: Hello, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. I understand that you are having issues streaming a movie. Is this the first time you have experienced this issue?

Customer: Yes, it is the first time. 

Agent: Okay, let's see what we can do to help. First, let's make sure that your account is active and up to date with payment. Do you know when your last payment was made?

Customer: Yes, my last payment was about a week ago. 

Agent: Great! That means your account should be active and up to date with payment. Now, let's make sure that your device is compatible with our streaming services. What device are you using?

Customer: I'm using an Android phone. 

Agent: Alright, that should be compatible with our streaming services. Let's make sure that you have the latest version of the Contoso Wireless app installed on your phone. Can you check and see if it is up to date?

Customer: Yes, I can do that. 

Agent: Perfect! Once you've checked that, try streaming the movie again and let me know if it works or not. 

Customer: Okay, I'll give it a try and let you know what happens. 

Agent: Sounds good! If the issue persists after updating the app, please don't hesitate to contact us again and we will try to figure out what the problem is. 

Customer: Alright, thank you for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, I think that's all for now. Thank you again for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day!
