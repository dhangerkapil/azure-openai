Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and I am having some issues with it.

Agent: Hi there! My name is [Name], and I'm a customer service representative for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer: Well, I bought the phone about a week ago and it's been acting up since. It keeps randomly turning off and restarting. I've tried resetting it, but nothing seems to work.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's see if we can find out what's going on with your phone. Could you tell me the make and model of the phone you purchased?

Customer: Sure, it's a Contoso Galaxy S20.

Agent: Okay, let me take a look at this. Can you tell me if you're using any third-party apps or services on the phone? 

Customer: No, nothing like that. Just the standard apps that came pre-installed. 

Agent: Alright, let me run some diagnostics on your phone to try and identify the issue. Can you please hold for just a few minutes while I do that? 

Customer: Sure, no problem. 

Agent: Great! Give me just a few minutes to check out your phone and then I'll be back with an update for you. 

(A few minutes later) 

Agent: Okay, I've finished running diagnostics on your phone and it looks like there may be an issue with the software. It appears that some of the system files have become corrupted, which is causing the random restarts and shutdowns. 

Customer: Is there anything I can do to fix it? 

Agent: Yes, absolutely! We can try performing a factory reset on your phone, which will restore all of the original settings and software back to their defaults. This should help resolve any software-related issues you're having with your phone. 

Customer: Okay, that sounds great. How do I go about doing that? 

Agent: Before we get started, it's important to note that performing a factory reset will delete any data or information stored on your device - including contacts, messages, photos, etc., so please make sure to back up anything important before we proceed. To begin the factory reset process, please press and hold the volume up and power buttons simultaneously until you see the Contoso logo appear onscreen - then release both buttons and follow the prompts from there to complete the reset process. 

Customer: Alright, got it! Thanks for your help - I'll give this a try and hopefully my phone will start working properly again soon! 

Agent: You're welcome! If you have any further issues or questions about your phone after completing the factory reset process, please don't hesitate to contact us again and we'll be more than happy to help out. Have a great day!
