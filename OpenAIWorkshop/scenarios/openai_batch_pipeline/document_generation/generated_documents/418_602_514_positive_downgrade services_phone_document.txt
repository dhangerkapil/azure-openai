Hello, I'm looking to downgrade my phone service from Contoso Wireless. Can you tell me what options I have? 

Agent:
Hello! Of course, I'd be more than happy to help you with that. Can I get some information about your current plan so I can better assist you? 

Customer: 
Sure! My current plan is the unlimited data, calling and texting one. 

Agent: 
Got it. We have a few different options available for downgrading your service. The first option is our 500 minutes per month plan which includes 500 minutes of talk, 500 texts and 500 megabytes of data. The second option is our pay as you go plan which allows you to purchase minutes, texts and data as you need them. Is there a particular plan you're interested in? 

Customer: 
I'm interested in the 500 minutes per month plan. Could you tell me more about it? 

Agent: 
Absolutely! With this plan, you'll receive 500 minutes of talk time, 500 text messages and 500 megabytes of data each month. This plan also comes with an additional 1GB of data if you pay your bill on time each month. 

Customer: 
That sounds great! What other features come with this plan? 

Agent: 
In addition to the features mentioned above, this plan also includes unlimited access to our customer support team, free voicemail and call waiting services, and access to our online account management tools. It also includes a 30-day money back guarantee if you're not satisfied with the service. 

Customer: 
That's awesome! How much does this plan cost? 

Agent: 
This plan costs $50 per month plus applicable taxes and fees. There is no contract required for this plan and you can cancel at any time without penalty. Does that sound like something that would work for you? 

Customer: 
Yes, that sounds perfect! How do I go about downgrading my service to this plan? 

Agent: 
Downgrading your service is easy! All you need to do is log into your Contoso Wireless account and select the "Downgrade Service" option. From there, follow the prompts to select the 500 minutes per month plan and complete the process. Once completed, your service will be downgraded to the new plan within 24 hours.
