Customer:
Hello, I am a customer of Contoso Wireless and I am disappointed with the upgrade services. I purchased a new phone a few weeks ago and I am having issues with it. Can you help me?

Agent:
Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm sorry to hear that you are having issues with your new phone. Can you tell me more about the problem you're having?

Customer:
Yes, the phone has been acting up since I got it. It keeps freezing, lagging, and shutting down randomly. It's really frustrating because I just got it and expected it to be better. 

Agent:
I understand your frustration and apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. Are you able to provide me with the make and model of the phone you purchased? 

Customer: 
Yes, the make is Samsung Galaxy S10 and the model is SM-G973U1. 

Agent: 
Thank you for that information. Could you please provide me with the serial number of your device? 

Customer: 
Yes, the serial number is ABC123456789. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing that information. Based on what you've told me, it appears that your device may have a hardware issue or a software issue. In order to better assist you, can you tell me if the phone was purchased directly from Contoso Wireless or from another retailer? 

Customer: 
It was purchased directly from Contoso Wireless. 

Agent: 
Thank you for confirming that information. In order to further assist you, we will need to troubleshoot your device in order to determine if there is a hardware or software issue causing the problems that you are experiencing. We can do this remotely or in person at one of our service centers. Which option would you prefer? 

Customer: 
I would prefer to do it remotely if possible. 

Agent: 
That is no problem at all! We can do this remotely by having one of our technical support agents access your device remotely and run some diagnostic tests to determine what is causing the issue. Would that be okay with you?
