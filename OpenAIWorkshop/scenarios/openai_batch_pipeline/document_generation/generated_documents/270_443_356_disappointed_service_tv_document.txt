Customer: Hello, I recently purchased a television from Contoso Wireless, and I'm disappointed with the service. I've been having issues with the TV since the day I bought it.

Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're not happy with your purchase. Can you tell me what's wrong with the TV?

Customer: Yes, for starters, the picture quality is terrible. It's very pixelated and blurry.

Agent: I understand how that would be disappointing. We take pride in our product and want our customers to be happy. Can you tell me what type of TV you purchased and what model it is?

Customer: I bought a Contoso HDTV, model number CTV-1001.

Agent: Alright, thank you for that information. Can you please provide me with your customer number so I can access your account?

Customer: Sure, my customer number is 9876543210.

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. After reviewing your account, it looks like we can offer you a replacement TV as we do have a 30-day return policy. Would that be something you'd be interested in? 

Customer: That would be great! Is there any way to speed up the process? 

Agent: Absolutely! We can have a new TV shipped out to you within 24 hours and will even cover the shipping costs for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should be it for now. Thank you for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you. Have a great day!
