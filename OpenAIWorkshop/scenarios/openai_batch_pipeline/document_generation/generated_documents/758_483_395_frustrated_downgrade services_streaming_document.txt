"I'm so frustrated with Contoso Wireless! I just switched from their streaming service and now my connection is terrible. What can you do to help me out?"

Agent:
"I apologize for your experience. We take customer satisfaction very seriously here at Contoso Wireless. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue you're having?"

Customer: 
"Well, I've had nothing but problems since I switched. My streaming service is constantly buffering and it's driving me crazy. I'm paying for a top tier package and I'm not getting what I'm paying for!"

Agent: 
"I understand your frustration. Is this happening with all of your streaming services or just one in particular?"

Customer: 
"It's happening with all of them, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc. It's really frustrating and I want to downgrade my service to save some money." 

Agent: 
"I understand why you want to downgrade your service, however that won't necessarily solve the issue you're having with your streaming. Are there any other options you would like us to consider?" 

Customer: 
"Well, can you tell me if there are any other options to improve my streaming performance? I really don't want to downgrade my service if it's not going to solve the problem." 

Agent: 
"Absolutely. We may be able to improve your streaming performance by changing your router or modem. We can also troubleshoot any existing equipment or settings that may be causing the issue." 

Customer: 
"Really? That would be great! Can we start by troubleshooting my current equipment?" 

Agent: 
"Of course! Before we do that though, let me first check if there are any available promotions or discounts that may be able to help you save on your current plan."
