Agent: Absolutely! What seems to be the problem?

Customer: I recently signed up for the Contoso Wireless streaming service and I haven't been able to make a payment. I'm confused about how it works.

Agent: I understand, we can certainly help you out. Are you using a credit card or a debit card for the payment?

Customer: Credit card. 

Agent: Alright, let's take a look. Can you provide us with the last four digits of your credit card number? 

Customer: Sure, it's xxxx. 

Agent: Perfect, thank you for providing that information. It looks like we have your payment on file. Are you experiencing any other issues with our streaming service? 

Customer: Yes, actually. I can't seem to access the content that I'm paying for. I've tried different devices but nothing seems to work. 

Agent: Okay, let's see if we can troubleshoot this issue together. Could you tell me what kind of device you're using? 

Customer: It's an iPhone 7. 

Agent: Great, thank you for providing that information. Could you please tell me what version of iOS your device is running? 

Customer: It's running iOS 10.3.4 

Agent: Alright, we'll need to make sure that your device is up to date in order for our streaming service to work properly. Please try updating your iOS version and then try accessing our streaming service again. If you're still having trouble after that, please let me know and we'll try to figure out what else might be causing the issue.
