Customer: 
"I'm so angry right now! I've been a customer of Contoso Wireless for years and I'm ready to churn. What do you have to say for yourselves?"

Agent: 
"I apologize for your frustration. Can you tell me what has caused you to consider leaving us?"

Customer: 
"I just don't feel like Contoso Wireless is offering enough value for what I'm paying. Other companies are offering better products for cheaper prices."

Agent: 
"I understand your concern. Can you tell me what it is about other companies' products that you find more attractive?"

Customer: 
"Well, for one thing, they offer better coverage in my area. They also have more data plans to choose from and the plans are cheaper than yours. Plus, their customer service is much better than yours."

Agent: 
"I can certainly understand why you would be unhappy with our services. We would hate to see you go, but if our current product offerings are not meeting your needs, we would like to offer you a few solutions that may be more suitable." 

Customer: 
"What kind of solutions are you talking about?" 

Agent: 
"We can offer you a discounted rate on our current plan or we can switch you over to a different plan with more data and coverage in your area. We can also look into providing additional discounts on other products and services that we offer." 

Customer: 
"That sounds interesting, but I'm still not sure it's enough to make me stay. What else can you do?" 

Agent: 
"We understand that cost is a major factor in your decision-making process and we want to make sure that we provide the best value possible for our customers. We are always open to feedback and would love to hear more about how we can improve our services so that they meet your needs."
