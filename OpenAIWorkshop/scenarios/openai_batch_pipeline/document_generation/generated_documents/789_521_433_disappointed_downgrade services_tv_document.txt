Customer: Hi, I recently downgraded my services with Contoso Wireless and I have some questions about the product. 

Customer Service Agent: Certainly. What would you like to know? 

Customer: Well, I downgraded my services to the basic package and I noticed that it does not include TV. Is there any way I can get access to TV services? 

Customer Service Agent: Unfortunately, our basic package does not include access to TV services. You will need to upgrade your package if you would like access to TV services. 

Customer: That's not what I was expecting. Is there any way you can make an exception for me? 

Customer Service Agent: I understand your disappointment, but unfortunately we are unable to make exceptions when it comes to packages and services. We are able to offer you a discounted rate on an upgraded package if you are interested. 

Customer: That's not really what I wanted to hear. Is there any other way I can get access to TV services without having to upgrade my package? 

Customer Service Agent: Unfortunately, no. The only way you can get access to TV services is by upgrading your package. We do have a variety of packages available that offer access to TV services at different prices and discounts, so you should be able to find one that fits your budget and needs. 

Customer: Okay, thank you for the information. Can you tell me more about the different packages that are available? 

Customer Service Agent: Certainly. We currently have five packages available, ranging from basic up to our premium package which includes all of our services and features. All of the packages include unlimited data, but each one has its own set of additional features such as streaming services, HD video quality, access to specific channels, and more. If you would like more information about each package and what it offers, please let me know and I can provide more details for you.
