Customer: 
"Hi, I'm really disappointed with Contoso Wireless. I recently purchased a streaming product from you and it hasn't been working properly. Can you help me?"

Agent:
Hello there! I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your streaming product. How can I help? 

Customer:
Well, the product isn't working at all. I've tried everything to get it to work but nothing has worked. 

Agent:
I understand how frustrating this must be. Can you tell me more about what you've tried so far? Have you checked the power connection? 

Customer:
Yes, I have checked the power connection and it's definitely plugged in properly. I've also tried restarting the device, but that didn't work either. 

Agent: 
I see. Have you also tried resetting the device? That can often solve many issues with streaming products. 

Customer: 
Yes, I did try resetting the device, but that didn't work either. Is there anything else I can try? 

Agent: 
Yes, there are a few other things you can try to get your streaming product working again. Can you tell me what type of device you're using and what operating system it is running on? 

Customer: 
I'm using an Android device and it's running on the latest version of the operating system. 

Agent: 
Ok, great! In this case, I would recommend trying to clear your device's cache and data and then restarting it again. This should help solve any issues with your streaming product. If that doesn't work, please let me know and we can look into other options for getting it working again.
