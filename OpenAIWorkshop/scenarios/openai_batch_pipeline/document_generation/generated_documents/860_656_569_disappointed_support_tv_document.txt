Hello, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm very disappointed in the service I have received for my product. I bought a tv from your store about two weeks ago, and it's been nothing but problems since then. I need some help with this.

Agent:

Hello, I apologize for the trouble you've been having with your tv. Can you please tell me what the issue is?

Customer: 

Yes, when I turn on the tv it will only show a black screen. No matter what I do, the picture won't show up. It's really frustrating because I bought this tv specifically to watch my favorite shows.

Agent: 

I understand how frustrating this can be. Please try unplugging the power cable from the back of the tv and plugging it back in again. This can sometimes help reset the tv and allow it to work properly again. 

Customer: 

I tried that already but it didn't work. Is there anything else I can do? 

Agent: 
Yes, if unplugging the power cable didn't help, then we can try a factory reset. This will erase all of your data and settings on the tv and will return it to its default settings. To do this, press and hold the power button on the tv for 10 seconds until you hear a beep sound. After that, release the power button and your tv should be reset to its original settings. 

Customer: 
I did that but it still isn't working. What else can I do? 

Agent: 
If none of these steps have worked, then it could be an issue with the hardware itself and you may need to bring your tv in for service. We offer a free repair or replacement service for products purchased from our store within 30 days of purchase. If you would like to take advantage of this service, please let me know and I will provide you with further instructions on how to proceed with this process. 

Customer: 
Yes, that would be great. Please provide me with those instructions so that I can get my tv fixed as soon as possible. 

Agent: 
Of course! In order to take advantage of our free repair or replacement service, you will need to bring your tv into one of our stores with a valid proof of purchase such as a receipt or invoice. Once we receive your tv at our store, we will inspect it and determine whether or not we can repair or replace it at no cost to you. Please note that if we determine that the issue is caused by user error or accidental damage, then we may not be able to offer free repair or replacement service in these cases.
