Customer: Hello, I am a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm looking for information on your upgrade services. 

Agent: Hi there! Welcome to Contoso Wireless. We are so glad to have you as a customer. How can I help you with upgrade services today? 

Customer: I am looking for information about upgrading my internet service. Could you tell me more about that? 

Agent: Absolutely! We offer several different plans to choose from that provide faster speeds, more data, and additional features. Can you tell me what type of internet service you currently have? 

Customer: I have the basic plan right now. It's not enough for all the streaming and gaming my family does. 

Agent: Got it. It sounds like you need an upgrade! We have several options available that would be perfect for your family's needs. Would you like me to go over them with you? 

Customer: Yes please. I'd love to hear more about them. 

Agent: Great! We have three main plans that would be perfect for your family's streaming and gaming needs. The first plan is our Standard plan which offers up to 20 Mbps download speeds and 10 GB of data each month. The second plan is our Pro plan which offers up to 100 Mbps download speeds and 50 GB of data each month. Finally, we have our Ultra plan which offers up to 500 Mbps download speeds and unlimited data each month. Do any of these plans sound like something your family could benefit from? 

Customer: Wow, those all sound great! I think the Ultra plan would be best for us, but I'm concerned about the cost of upgrading my service. Could you tell me more about that? 

Agent: Sure thing! The Ultra plan is our most expensive option but it also provides the most benefits. The cost of upgrading to this plan is $99/month plus taxes and fees, but we do offer discounts if you sign up for an annual subscription or bundle with other services such as home phone or TV. Would you like me to go over those options with you as well? 

Customer: That would be great! I think bundling would be a good option for us since we already use Contoso Wireless for our home phone service. Can you tell me more about that? 

Agent: Absolutely! If you bundle your internet service with our home phone service, you will receive a discounted rate of $79/month plus taxes and fees for the Ultra plan. Additionally, if you sign up for an annual subscription, we will waive the setup fee and give you an additional discount of $10/month off your total bill. Does this sound like something that interests you? 

Customer: That sounds amazing! Yes, I definitely want to take advantage of those discounts. How do I go about signing up? 

Agent: Great! All you need to do is call our customer service line at 1-800-CONTOSO or visit our website at www.contosowireless.com/upgrade-services to get started. Our team will be happy to assist you with the signup process and answer any questions that may come up along the way.
