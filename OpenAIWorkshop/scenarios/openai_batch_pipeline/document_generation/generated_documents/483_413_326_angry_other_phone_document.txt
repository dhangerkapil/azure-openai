Customer:

"I just got my new phone from Contoso Wireless and it's not working. I'm so frustrated and angry. What is going on?"

Agent:

"I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. Can you please provide me with some details about your issue so that I can help you further?"

Customer: 

"Yes, of course. When I try to turn the phone on, it won't even power up. I've tried different outlets and charging cables, but nothing seems to work."

Agent: 

"I understand. That certainly sounds like an issue. Have you attempted to perform a hard reset of the device?" 

Customer: 

"No, I haven't done that yet. How do I do it?" 

Agent: 

"To perform a hard reset of your device, first you will need to locate the power button and volume buttons on your phone. Then, press and hold both buttons at the same time for around 10 seconds until the phone powers off. After that, simply turn your device back on again and see if the issue is resolved." 

Customer: 

"Okay, I'll give that a try. Hopefully it works." 

Agent: 

"That's great! Let me know how it goes." 

 Customer: 

 "Alright, I'll get back to you shortly."

 Agent:

 "No problem. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further assistance or have any additional questions."
