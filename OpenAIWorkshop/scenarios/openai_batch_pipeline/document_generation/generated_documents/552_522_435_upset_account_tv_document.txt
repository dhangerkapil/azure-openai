Agent: Hi there, I apologize for the inconvenience. I can certainly help you with this. Can you tell me more about the issue you’re experiencing? 

Customer: Yes, I just purchased the tv yesterday and when I tried to set it up, it wouldn’t turn on. It seemed like it was completely dead. 

Agent: Alright, let’s see if we can troubleshoot this issue. Can you confirm that you have followed the installation instructions correctly? 

Customer: Yes, I followed all of the instructions and even tried plugging it in to a different outlet just to be sure. 

Agent: Okay, that's great. Have you checked to make sure that your Contoso Wireless account is active and in good standing? 

Customer: Yes, my account is active and I have no past due payments or anything like that. 

Agent: That's great news. Let's take a look at the tv itself then. Are there any lights or indicators on the device when it is plugged in? 

Customer: Yes, there are three small lights that come on when it is plugged in but they all turn off after a few seconds and nothing else happens. 

Agent: Alright, this could be an issue with the device itself then. Since you just purchased it yesterday, it should still be under warranty so we can arrange for a replacement or repair for you if necessary. In order to do so, we will need to verify some information from your Contoso Wireless account first. Can you provide me with your account number? 

Customer: Yes, my account number is #######-#####-#####-#####. 

Agent: Perfect! Thank you for providing that information. Now, let me just pull up your account information here so we can start the process of getting a replacement or repair for your tv...
