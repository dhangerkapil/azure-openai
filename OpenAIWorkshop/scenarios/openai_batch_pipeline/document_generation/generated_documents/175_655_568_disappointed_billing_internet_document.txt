Customer:

Hi, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm having some issues with my billing. I recently signed up for internet service, but the bill I received doesn't seem to match what I was expecting. Can you help me understand what's going on?

Agent:

Hello, thank you for reaching out to us at Contoso Wireless. I apologize for any confusion regarding your bill. We'd be happy to look into this for you and help clarify what is going on. Can you tell me a bit more about your issue?

Customer: 

Yes, sure. I signed up for internet service from Contoso Wireless and the bill that I received doesn't seem to match what I was expecting. It's higher than I anticipated and it's confusing to me. Can you explain why the bill is higher than expected?

Agent: 

I understand your confusion and we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. We can certainly look into this for you and explain why the bill is higher than expected. We'll need a few details from you before we can begin, such as your account number, the type of internet service you signed up for, and any additional services that may have been added to your account. 

Customer: 

Sure, my account number is XXXX-XXXX-XXXX and I signed up for the basic internet package. As far as additional services, no, nothing has been added to my account since signing up. 

Agent: 

Thank you for providing those details. Let me take a look at your account and see if there's anything that may have caused an increase in your bill. One moment please while I review your account information. 

 Customer: 

Okay, thank you. 

 Agent: 

After reviewing your account information, it appears that the increase in your bill is due to an additional data package that was added to your account without your knowledge or consent. This data package allows for additional data usage beyond the limits of your basic internet package, which can result in an increased monthly fee. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused and would be happy to remove the additional data package from your account if you'd like. 

 Customer: 

Yes, please remove the additional data package from my account as soon as possible. Is there anything else I need to do? 

 Agent: 
Yes, I have removed the additional data package from your account and updated your billing information accordingly. You should receive an updated statement reflecting these changes in the next few days. If there are any further questions or concerns about your billing or services please don't hesitate to reach out again. Thank you for being a valued customer of Contoso Wireless!
