Customer: Hi, I am interested in upgrading my internet service with Contoso Wireless. Can you help me with that?

Agent: Absolutely! We would love to help you upgrade your internet service. Can you tell me a bit more about what you are looking for?

Customer: Sure, I'm looking for a fast and reliable internet connection that won't break the bank.

Agent: No problem! We have several options available that may suit your needs. What type of speeds are you looking for? 

Customer: I'm hoping for something at least 100 Mbps.

Agent: Great! We have several plans that meet that requirement. Would you like to hear about them? 

Customer: Yes please!

Agent: Our 100 Mbps plan comes with unlimited data, no contracts, and no hidden fees. It also includes a complimentary wireless router so you can easily access the internet on all your devices. The plan is $49.99 per month plus taxes and fees. 

Customer: That sounds great! What other options do I have? 

Agent: We also offer a 200 Mbps plan which comes with unlimited data, no contracts, and no hidden fees as well as a complimentary wireless router. This plan is $69.99 per month plus taxes and fees. 

Customer: That sounds perfect! Is there any way to get a better deal on the 200 Mbps plan? 

Agent: Yes, we do have promotional offers available on our 200 Mbps plan. If you sign up today, you can get the first three months free and the fourth month at half price. 

Customer: Wow, that's an amazing deal! How do I sign up? 

Agent: You can either sign up online or give us a call at 1-800-CONTOSO and one of our customer service representatives will be happy to help you with the process. 

Customer: Great! I think I'll sign up online. Is there anything else I should know before I do that? 

Agent: Not at all! Once you've completed the sign up process, we'll send out a technician to install your new modem and router so you can start using the internet right away. Please keep in mind that installation fees may apply depending on your location. 

Customer: Got it, thanks for all your help!
