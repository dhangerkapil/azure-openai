Agent: Absolutely! Let me just pull up your account information and we can go from there. What type of services are you looking to downgrade?

Customer: I have a tv package and would like to downgrade that. 

Agent: Okay, no problem. What kind of tv package do you currently have? 

Customer: I currently have the Contoso Ultimate Package. 

Agent: Okay, great. Now let me just check what options you have available for downgrading your tv package. It looks like you can downgrade to the Contoso Basic Package which offers over 70 channels, or the Contoso Select Package which offers over 100 channels. Which package would you prefer? 

Customer: Could you explain the differences between the two packages? 

Agent: Of course! The Contoso Basic Package offers 70 channels, including access to major networks and cable channels, as well as access to popular streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu. The Contoso Select Package offers over 100 channels and includes access to premium networks such as HBO, Showtime, and Starz. 

Customer: Hmm...I think I'll go with the Contoso Select Package. 

Agent: Great! I'm happy to hear that. Now let me just make sure I have all of your information correct before I process the downgrade. Is your name still [customer's name]? 

Customer: Yes, that's correct. 

Agent: Perfect! Now let me just confirm that you would like to downgrade your current tv package from the Contoso Ultimate Package to the Contoso Select Package? 

Customer: Yes, that's correct. 

Agent: Wonderful! Now all I need is for you to confirm your billing information so I can process the downgrade for you today. Can I please have your billing address and payment information? 

Customer: Sure, here it is [billing address and payment information]. 

Agent: Perfect! Now let me just process this for you so you can start enjoying your new tv package right away. Please give me one moment while I do this for you...Okay, great! Your new tv package has been successfully downgraded and will be available in the next 24-48 hours. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
