Customer:

Good morning, I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless phone and I'm not satisfied with the product. I've been trying to upgrade it, but it's been nothing but a hassle. Can you help me out?

Customer Service Agent:

Good morning! I apologize for the inconvenience you've experienced while trying to upgrade your phone. We take our customer satisfaction very seriously here at Contoso Wireless and we'll do everything we can to help you out. Can you tell me what type of phone you have and what type of upgrade you're looking for?

Customer: 

Yes, I have an iPhone 8 Plus and I'm looking to upgrade to an iPhone 11 Pro Max. Is that something that is possible? 

Customer Service Agent: 

Absolutely! We offer an array of upgrade options for all of our customers. You can purchase the iPhone 11 Pro Max directly from us or you can purchase it from another retailer and bring it to us for activation. Do you have any questions about either option? 

Customer: 

Yes, I do. If I purchase the phone from another retailer, how long will it take to activate? 

Customer Service Agent: 

It typically takes 1-2 business days for us to activate a device purchased from another retailer. After the activation process is complete, you will be able to use your new device right away. Does that answer your question? 

Customer: 

Yes, that does answer my question. Are there any additional fees associated with activating a device purchased from another retailer? 

Customer Service Agent: 
No, there are no additional fees associated with activating a device purchased from another retailer. All you need to do is bring the device to us and we'll take care of the rest. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

 Customer: 

 No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help!
