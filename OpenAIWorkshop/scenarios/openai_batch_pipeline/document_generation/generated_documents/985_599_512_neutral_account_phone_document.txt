Agent: Hi there! We have a great selection of phones for you to choose from. What type of phone are you looking for? 

Customer: I'm looking for something with a lot of storage, a good camera, and a long battery life.

Agent: We have the perfect phone for you. It's the Contoso Wireless PX4. It has a whopping 256GB of storage, an 8MP camera, and an extended battery life of up to 18 hours. Would you like to hear more about this phone? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds great. What other features does it have?

Agent: The PX4 also has a 5.5 inch HD display, an octa-core processor, and 4G LTE connectivity. It runs on the latest Android operating system and comes with pre-loaded apps like Google Maps, Gmail, and YouTube. Plus, it has wireless charging capability so you can charge your phone without plugging it in. 

Customer: That's really impressive. What about the cost?

Agent: The PX4 retails for $599 but we're currently offering a 10% discount for new customers. With the discount, it would be just $539. 

Customer: That sounds like a great deal! Do you offer any payment plans? 

Agent: Absolutely! We offer several payment plan options so you can spread out the cost over several months if needed. The most popular plan is our 12-month interest free plan where you can pay off the phone in 12 equal monthly payments with no interest or fees attached. 

Customer: That sounds great! How do I set up an account with Contoso Wireless? 

Agent: Setting up an account is easy! All you need to do is go to our website and fill out the registration form with your name, address, and payment information. Once you've completed the registration process, you'll be able to start shopping for phones right away. 

Customer: Okay, that sounds easy enough. Do I need to sign any contracts? 

Agent: No contracts are required when setting up your account. All we need is your basic information and payment information to get started. If you decide to purchase one of our phones, then we will require a signed agreement before we process your order.
