Customer: Hi, I've been trying to figure out why I'm being charged for the streaming service I've been using. It's really frustrating because I thought it was part of my plan. 

Customer Service Agent: I understand your frustration. Can you please tell me what plan you have and what type of streaming service it is?

Customer: Sure, I have the basic plan and I'm using the Netflix streaming service. 

Customer Service Agent: Ok, let me take a look at your account and see what's going on. Please hold while I investigate.

Customer Service Agent: Alright, I'm seeing that you are being charged for Netflix streaming because it's an add-on service. It's not included in the basic plan. 

Customer: That doesn't make any sense! Why wasn't I told this when I signed up? 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for any confusion, but unfortunately this information is available on our website when signing up for a plan. It also appears in the fine print on the agreement you signed when signing up for the plan. 

Customer: That's really frustrating because I didn't see any of that information when signing up. Is there anything you can do about this? 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, of course! We can offer you a discounted rate on the streaming service for the next three months as a way to make up for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused you. Would that be acceptable? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great! Thank you so much for your help. 

Customer Service Agent: You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
