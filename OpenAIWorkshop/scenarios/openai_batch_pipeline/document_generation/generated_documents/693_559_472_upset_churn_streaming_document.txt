Hello, this is [Name] from Contoso Wireless customer service. How may I help you today? 

Customer:

I’m having a problem with the streaming service. It keeps buffering and lagging when I try to watch a show. 

Customer Service Agent:

I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing? 

Customer:

Yeah, I’ve been trying to watch a show on the streaming service but it keeps lagging and buffering. It’s really annoying and it’s making it impossible for me to watch anything. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I completely understand how frustrating this can be. Is this happening on all shows or just one particular show? 

Customer: 
It’s happening on all of them. It doesn’t matter what show I try to watch, it just keeps buffering and lagging. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. I want to make sure we get this issue resolved as soon as possible. Are you using the latest version of the streaming service? 

Customer: 
Yes, I updated it yesterday but it still isn’t working properly. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Okay, let me take a look at your account and see if there are any issues that could be causing this problem. Can I have your account number please? 

 Customer:  Sure, it’s [Account Number]. 

 Customer Service Agent:  Thank you for providing that information. Let me take a look and see if I can find out what’s causing the issue. In the meantime, would you like to try restarting your device? This might help with resolving the issue. 

 Customer:  Sure, I can try that but I don’t think it will make a difference. Is there anything else you can do? 

 Customer Service Agent: Yes, we can definitely look into other options as well. Can you tell me more about why you are using the streaming service? Are you looking to switch providers or are you just having trouble with the current provider?
