Customer:
Hello, I recently bought a Contoso Wireless phone and I'm not happy with it. Can you tell me what I can do?

Agent:
Hello there! Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I'm sorry to hear that you're not satisfied with the phone. Could you tell me more about your experience? 

Customer:
Well, it's been a complete disaster. The phone is slow, unreliable and the battery drains too quickly. Plus, the camera quality isn't that great either.
