Customer: Hi, I'm having some confusion with my payment.

Agent: Hi, how can I help?

Customer: I'm trying to understand how the product streaming works with Contoso Wireless. 

Agent: Sure, we're happy to help you understand how the product streaming works. Are you having any issues making payments for the product streaming? 

Customer: Yes, I'm not sure if I'm being charged for it or not. 

Agent: That's understandable. We'd be happy to help you with that. Could you tell me a bit more about what kind of confusion you are experiencing? 

Customer: Well, I signed up for the product streaming and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be paying for it or not. I've been trying to figure out how much it costs and when the payments are due, but it's all very confusing. 

Agent: Okay, let me see if I can explain it a bit better for you. The product streaming is a subscription-based service that allows you to access all of our products without any additional charges. You will only be charged once a month on the same day that you signed up for the service. This charge will be based on the amount of products you have streamed during that month and will be automatically deducted from your account. Is this helpful? 

Customer: Yes, that's very helpful. So if I don't stream any products during a month, then I won't be charged? 

Agent: That's correct! You will only be charged for the products that you stream during that month and nothing else. 

Customer: Great! One more question - what happens if I decide to cancel my subscription before the end of the month? Will I still get charged for the products that I have already streamed? 

Agent: No, you will not be charged for any products that you have streamed prior to cancelling your subscription. You will only be charged for products that you have streamed during the current billing period, regardless of when your subscription ends.
