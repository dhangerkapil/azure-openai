I've been trying for days and it just won't work! I can't get the new speed I was promised and it's really frustrating.

I understand your frustration. Let me take a look and see if I can help. Can you tell me what kind of internet service do you currently have?

I'm subscribed to the basic plan, but I want to upgrade to the premium plan.

Alright, thanks.

No problem. I have checked and there are indeed upgrades available for your current subscription plan. Would you like to go ahead and upgrade now?
