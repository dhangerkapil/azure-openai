Customer: 
Hello, I am having trouble with my internet service from Contoso Wireless. I have had the service for a few months now and I am not getting the speed that was promised to me when I signed up.

Agent: 
Hello, I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please provide me with your account number so I can look into the issue?

Customer: 
Sure, it is 1234-5678-9012.

Agent: 
Thank you. I'm looking into your account now and it looks like your plan is for up to 25 Mbps download speed. Can you confirm that this is the plan you signed up for?

Customer: 
Yes, that is correct. However, I have been consistently getting speeds of only 10 Mbps. That's not even half of what I was promised!

Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this must be and apologize again for the inconvenience. Could you tell me more about the issue? Are you experiencing slow speeds all of the time or just at certain times?

Customer: 
It's slow all of the time. It doesn't matter what time of day it is or what I'm doing online. The speed is always around 10 Mbps. It's very frustrating because I need to be able to do work online and this isn't cutting it. 

Agent: 
I understand your frustration. Let me take a closer look at your account and see if there is anything else going on that could be causing this issue. In the meantime, can you tell me if you've tried restarting your modem and router? That can sometimes help improve internet speed. 

Customer: 
Yes, I have tried restarting them several times and it hasn't made any difference in the speed. 

Agent: 
Alright, I'm still looking into your account but in the meantime, could you provide me with a few more details about your setup? Are you using an ethernet cable or are you connected wirelessly? Also, are there any other devices connected to your network that could be slowing down your connection? 

 Customer: 
I am connected wirelessly and there are a few other devices connected to my network but they are not being used while I am trying to use the internet so they shouldn't be causing any issues.
