Customer: Hi, [Name]. I'm having trouble with my monthly payment. I was wondering if you could explain it to me?

Customer Service Agent: Of course! Can you tell me a bit more about what's going on? 

Customer: Sure. I have a Contoso Wireless plan that includes internet access, but I'm not sure what the payment is for. 

Customer Service Agent: Sure, let me explain. Your monthly payment covers your internet service as well as the access and usage fees associated with the plan. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: Yes, actually. What kind of internet speeds do I get with my plan? 

Customer Service Agent: You will be able to access up to 100Mbps download speed with your plan, which is more than enough for streaming, gaming, and other online activities. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thanks for your help! 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can do for you today? 

Customer: No, that should be it. Thanks again! 

Customer Service Agent: No problem at all! Have a great day and thank you for being a valued customer of Contoso Wireless.
