Customer: 
Hello, I'm very upset about the downgrade of services with Contoso Wireless. I'm having a lot of problems streaming my product. Can you help me out?

Agent: 
Hello, I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you tell me more about the issue you are experiencing?

Customer: 
Yes, the streaming has become extremely slow and unreliable. It seems like it's taking forever to get anything done. Is there something that can be done to improve the service?

Agent: 
I understand your frustration. We are aware of the issue and are working hard to resolve it as quickly as possible. In the meantime, can you tell me more about your product streaming needs so that I can try to find a solution for you?

Customer: 
Well, I need to be able to stream videos, audio files, and other digital content without any buffering or lag. Is that something that Contoso Wireless can provide?

Agent: 
Yes, we can certainly provide a high-quality streaming experience for your product. However, due to the recent downgrade in our services, we may not be able to provide the same level of performance as before. We are working hard to resolve this issue as soon as possible. In the meantime, can I offer any other solutions or recommendations?

Customer: 
Yes, what other options do I have? I'm very unhappy with this downgrade in services and need something that works better. 

Agent: 
We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the downgrade in services. We understand how important it is for you to have reliable streaming capabilities and we are doing our best to rectify this issue as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I can recommend a few alternatives that may help improve your streaming experience. For example, if you have access to an unlimited data plan or Wi-Fi connection, this will allow you to stream your content faster and more reliably than before. Additionally, if you have access to a higher speed internet connection, this will also help improve your streaming performance. Do either of these solutions sound like they might be helpful for you? 

Customer: 
Yes, that does sound helpful. But what about my current subscription with Contoso Wireless? Is there any way to get a better deal on my current plan or upgrade my service level without having to pay extra? 

Agent: 
At this time we do not offer any upgrades or discounts on our current plans. However, if you would like to switch plans or upgrade your service level, we would be happy to discuss those options with you further. Do you think switching plans or upgrading would be something that could help improve your streaming experience?
