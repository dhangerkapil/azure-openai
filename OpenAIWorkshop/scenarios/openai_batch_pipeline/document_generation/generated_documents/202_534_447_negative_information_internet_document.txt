"I'm not happy with the internet I'm getting from Contoso Wireless. It's too slow and unreliable. Can you tell me what I can do to make it better?"

Agent: 
"I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. We want to make sure that our customers are satisfied with the services we provide. Could you tell me more about what kind of issues you're having with the internet?"

Customer: 
"Well, for starters, the internet is too slow. I can't even stream videos without it buffering. And it often times just drops out completely."

Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me see what I can do to help improve your connection speed and stability. What type of router are you currently using?"

Customer: 
"I'm using a Contoso Wireless router."

Agent: 
"That's great. I'm sure we can get your internet running smoothly in no time. Could you please provide me with your router's model number so that I can look up some information about it?"

Customer: 
"Sure, it's the Contoso Wireless WIF-1000."

Agent: 
"Great, thank you for that information. After reviewing your router's specs, I have a few suggestions that may help improve your internet connection speed and reliability. First, try resetting your router by unplugging it from the power source and plugging it back in after a few minutes. This should help clear any cached data and refresh your connection. Additionally, I suggest you check for any firmware updates for your router and install them if available. Lastly, make sure there are no other devices connected to the same network as your router that could be taking up bandwidth."

Customer: 
"Ok, I'll try those things out. Hopefully they will help." 

Agent: 
"Absolutely! Those should help improve your connection speed and stability significantly. If those suggestions don't work or if you experience any other issues with the internet, please don't hesitate to contact us again so we can further assist you."
