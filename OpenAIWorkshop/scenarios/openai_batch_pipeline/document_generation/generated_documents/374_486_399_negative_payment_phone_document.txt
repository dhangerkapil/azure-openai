Hello, I'm having some trouble with my payment for my Contoso Wireless phone. Can you help?

Agent: 
Hello, and thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. We'd be more than happy to help you with any payment issues you may be experiencing. What seems to be the problem?

Customer: 
I'm trying to make a payment but I'm not sure how to do it. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to pay in cash or online.

Agent: 
No problem, we can help you with that. Payments for Contoso Wireless phones can be made either in cash or online. Which method would you prefer? 

Customer: 
I think I'd like to pay online, but I'm not sure how to do it. Could you walk me through the process? 

Agent: 
Absolutely! To make an online payment, simply go to our website and log in to your account. Once logged in, select the "Make a Payment" option from the menu and follow the instructions. Once you have completed the payment process, you will receive a confirmation email that your payment has been processed. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: 
No, that should do it. But I still have a question about the phone itself. Do I need to activate it before making a payment? 

Agent: 
No, you do not need to activate your Contoso Wireless phone before making a payment. However, once your payment is processed, we recommend activating your phone as soon as possible so that you can begin using it right away. Is there anything else we can help you with? 

Customer: 
No, that should do it. Thanks for all your help! 

Agent: 
You're welcome! It was our pleasure to assist you today. Have a great day!
