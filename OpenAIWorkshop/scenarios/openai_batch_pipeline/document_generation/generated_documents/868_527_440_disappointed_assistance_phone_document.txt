Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your phone. What seems to be the issue?

Customer: It's been randomly turning off and on all day.

Agent: That doesn't sound good. Have you tried rebooting it or performing a soft reset?

Customer: Yes, I've done both of those things and it still won't stay on.

Agent: Okay, I understand. Let me see if I can help you figure out what the problem might be. Is there any software installed on the phone that may be causing the issue? 

Customer: No, I haven't installed anything new recently.

Agent: Alright. Could you tell me what model of phone you have and when you purchased it? 

Customer: It's a Contoso Wireless Galaxy S20 and I bought it a few months ago. 

Agent: Alright, thank you for that information. Have you had any similar issues with the phone before? 

Customer: No, this is the first time something like this has happened. 

Agent: Okay, let me take a look at your account and see what I can do to help you resolve this issue. Can you provide me with your account number so I can look into it further? 

Customer: Sure, here it is [account number]. 

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. I will investigate this further and get back to you with an update as soon as possible. In the meantime, could you please provide me with your contact information so that I can reach out to you? 

Customer: Sure, my email address is [email] and my phone number is [phone number].
