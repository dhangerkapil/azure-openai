Hello, I'm calling because I am extremely unhappy with the downgrade of services Contoso Wireless has offered me. I recently switched to your company and have been disappointed with the product ever since. I was hoping to get some help understanding what other options I have?

Agent: 
Hello, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. I apologize for any dissatisfaction you may have experienced with our services. Can you please tell me more about what specifically you are looking for in a product?

Customer: 
Well, when I switched to Contoso Wireless, I was promised a high-speed internet connection and unlimited data, but it seems like my connection is much slower than advertised and my data plan is limited. I'm looking for something that will provide me with a reliable connection and no data limits.

Agent: 
I understand your frustration. We do offer several plans that may meet your needs. Our highest speed connection is currently 100 Mbps, which is more than enough for most households. As far as data limits go, we have an unlimited plan available for an additional fee. Would this be something that would interest you?

Customer: 
Yes, that sounds perfect! How much would it cost for the upgraded service?

Agent: 
The total cost for the upgraded service would be $59.99 per month. This includes the 100 Mbps connection speed and unlimited data plan. Is this something you'd be interested in signing up for?

Customer: 
Yes, that sounds great! Can you also tell me what other services are included in this plan? For example, do you offer any additional features or discounts?

Agent: 
Yes, we do offer a variety of additional features and discounts with our upgraded service. These include free access to our online customer portal, 24/7 customer support, and discounts on select products and services. We also offer discounts to customers who sign up for multiple years at once. Would this be something you're interested in learning more about?

Customer: 
Yes, definitely! Can you tell me more about the discounts and how much I can save if I sign up for multiple years? 

Agent: 
Sure thing! If you sign up for multiple years at once, you can save up to 20% off your total bill. That means if you sign up for three years at once, you would save an additional $14 per month on your bill. Does this sound like something that would work for you?
