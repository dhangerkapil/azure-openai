Hello, I'm having a problem with my Contoso Wireless product. I bought it a few days ago and it's not working correctly. Can you help me?

Agent:
Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that you're having issues with your Contoso Wireless product. I'd be happy to help you get this sorted out. What type of product do you have?

Customer:
I have the Contoso Wireless Other model. It's supposed to be able to connect to the internet, but it's not working.

Agent:
I see. The Other model is a great product, so I'm sure we can get this sorted out. Could you tell me a bit more about what's happening? Are you having trouble connecting to the internet?

Customer:
Yes, that's exactly it. I'm connected to the Wi-Fi network, but when I try to open a web page, nothing happens. It just stays on the loading screen forever.

Agent:
Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Let's see if we can get this fixed up for you. Could you please tell me what kind of Wi-Fi network you're connecting to? Is it 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz? 

Customer: 
It's 2.4 GHz. 

Agent: 
Ok, that's good to know. Could you also tell me if you've tried any troubleshooting steps already? Have you tried restarting your device or resetting your router? 

Customer: 
Yes, I've tried both of those things and nothing has worked so far. 

Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Let me take a look at this for you and see what we can do to get this resolved as quickly as possible. Can I put you on hold for a few minutes while I investigate this further? 

Customer: 
Yes, that would be great. Thank you for your help.
