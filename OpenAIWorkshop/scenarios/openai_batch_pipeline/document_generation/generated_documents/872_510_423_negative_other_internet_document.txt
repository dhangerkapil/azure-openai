I understand how inconvenient this must be for you. Let me take a look into this further and see what I can do to help. Could you please confirm that your router is properly connected?

Ok great, thanks for confirming that. Could you tell me which device you're having trouble with? Is it a laptop, desktop or mobile device?

It's my laptop that's having issues connecting to the internet.
