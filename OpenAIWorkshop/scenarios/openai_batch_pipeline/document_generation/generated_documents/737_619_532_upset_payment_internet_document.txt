Agent: Hello, I'm sorry to hear that. What seems to be the issue?

Customer: Well, I received a bill today and it says I'm being charged for a Contoso Wireless internet plan, but I don't have any internet plan. What's going on?

Agent: That's strange. Let me take a look at your account and see what I can find out. Can you provide me with your account number?

Customer: Sure, it's [account number].

Agent: Thanks. Let me just take a moment to look into this for you. 

(A few moments later) 

Agent: Okay, it looks like there was an error in our system and you were accidentally billed for an internet plan that you didn't sign up for. We'll go ahead and refund the charge for you and make sure it doesn't happen again. 

Customer: That's great! But why did this happen in the first place? 

Agent: We're still trying to figure that out. We recently upgraded our systems and we think this may have caused the issue. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you and we'll be sure to investigate further so that it doesn't happen again in the future. 

Customer: Alright, thank you for your help. 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: Actually, yes. Could you tell me a bit more about the Contoso Wireless internet plans? What do they offer and how much do they cost? 

Agent: Sure! We offer several different plans depending on your needs and budget. Our basic plan starts at $39 per month and includes up to 50 Mbps of download speeds with unlimited data usage. We also have several higher-priced plans that offer faster speeds and more features. If you'd like to learn more, I can send you a link to our website where you can compare our different plans and pricing options in more detail. 

Customer: That sounds great! Could you please send me that link? 

Agent: Absolutely! I'll send it to you right now. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should be all. Thank you very much for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day!
