Hello, I recently purchased a new internet package from Contoso Wireless and I'm having some issues. The service has been spotty and unreliable. Can you help? 

Agent:

Good afternoon, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless! I apologize for any issues you have been experiencing with your service. Can you provide me with more information about the problems you are facing?

Customer: 
Yes, I've noticed that my internet connection is slow and often drops out. It's been going on for about a week now and it's really frustrating.

Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this can be. Can you please tell me what type of device or devices you are using to access the internet? 

Customer: 
Yes, I'm using an Apple laptop and an iPhone to access the internet. 

Agent: 
Thank you for the information. Could you please provide me with the serial numbers of your devices so that I can further investigate the issue? 

Customer: 
Yes, here they are [serial numbers]. 

Agent: 
Thank you for the serial numbers. I will investigate further and get back to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, could you please try restarting both your laptop and your phone to see if that helps improve your connection? 

Customer: 
Yes, I will try that. What else can be done to fix this issue? 

Agent: 
I am currently working on identifying the source of the issue and finding a solution. In the meantime, we suggest running a speed test from your laptop or phone to see if there is an issue with your speed or connection. Additionally, it may be helpful to reset your router or modem as well as unplugging them for at least 10 seconds before plugging them back in again. This may help improve your connection as well. Let me know if this helps or if there is anything else I can do to assist you with this issue.
