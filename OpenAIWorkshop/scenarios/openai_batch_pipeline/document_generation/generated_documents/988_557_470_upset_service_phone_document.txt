Customer: Hi, I am a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm very upset with the service I have received. I recently purchased a phone from your company and the product isn't working properly. 

Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're unhappy with your purchase. What seems to be the issue?

Customer: The phone isn't connecting to the internet. It keeps giving me an error message.

Agent: That is certainly concerning. Can you please describe what the error message says? 

Customer: It says "Connection Failed". 

Agent: Ok, let me take a look at this for you. Could you please provide me with your account information and the serial number of the phone? 

Customer: Yes, my account number is 123456 and the serial number is ABCD123. 

Agent: Thank you for that information. Could you please tell me how long you have been experiencing this issue? 

Customer: It's been about two weeks now. 

Agent: Alright, I can understand why you would be frustrated with this problem. Let me take a closer look at your account and see if I can figure out what's going on. In the meantime, could you please try restarting your phone to see if that helps? 

Customer: I already did that but it didn't help. 

Agent: Ok, that's understandable. Let me just check a few things here and I should be able to get this resolved for you quickly. Can you please wait while I look into this further? 

Customer: Yes, sure. 

Agent: Alright, thank you for your patience. After reviewing your account information, it looks like there was an issue with the settings on your phone which caused it to not connect to the internet properly. I have gone ahead and corrected the settings so it should be working now. Can you please try connecting again and let me know if it works? 

Customer: Yes, I will try now and let you know if it works. 

Agent: Perfect! Please let me know how it goes and if there is anything else I can do for you today. 

Customer: Sure, thank you for your help!
