Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble with my Contoso Wireless product.

Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that. What seems to be the problem?

Customer: I just bought a Contoso Wireless TV and it won't turn on.

Agent: Alright, let's see what we can do to help you out. Have you tried plugging it in and checking the power cord?

Customer: Yes, I've already checked the power cord and it's plugged in correctly. 

Agent: Hmm, okay. Is there any indication of power on the device at all? Any lights or sounds? 

Customer: No, there is no indication of power whatsoever. 

Agent: Alright, let's try a few other things. Have you tried resetting the TV by unplugging it from the wall for 10 seconds and then plugging it back in? 

Customer: No, I haven't tried that yet. 

Agent: Okay, that could be a good way to reset it. Let's give that a try and see if that helps. 

Customer: Alright, I'll try that now. 

Agent: Great! While you're doing that, let me go ahead and make sure everything looks good on our end as far as your service and account goes.  Can you please confirm your name and address for me? 

Customer: Sure, my name is John Smith and my address is 123 Main Street, Anytown USA. 

Agent: Perfect, thank you for that information. I just want to make sure everything looks okay on our end before we proceed with troubleshooting the device. Give me one moment while I check this information for you. 

 [Pause]

 Agent: Alright, everything looks good on our end so far. Have you had a chance to try resetting the TV yet? 

 Customer: Yes, I've already done that but it still isn't turning on. 

 Agent: Alright, well let's take a look at some other potential causes of this issue then. Are you using any surge protectors or power strips with this TV? 

 Customer: Yes, I'm using a surge protector with it. 

 Agent: Okay, let's try unplugging the TV from the surge protector and plugging it directly into the wall outlet instead and see if that helps. Does that sound like something you can do?
