Customer: Hi, I was hoping to get some help with streaming a product on your service. 

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! What kind of product are you trying to stream? 

Customer: I'm trying to stream a movie. 

Customer Service Agent: Great! Before we get started, could you please verify your account by providing your Contoso Wireless account number? 

Customer: Sure, it's 123456789. 

Customer Service Agent: Perfect, thank you for verifying your account. Now, let's get you streaming that movie! First, I'll need you to tell me which device you're using to stream the movie. 

Customer: I'm using an iPhone. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, great. The next step is to make sure that you have the most up-to-date version of the Contoso Wireless app installed on your device. Is that already done? 

Customer: No, it isn't. How do I do that? 

Customer Service Agent: No problem at all! You can easily update the app by going to the App Store and searching for the Contoso Wireless app. Once you've found it, simply tap on the "Update" button and the app will update automatically. 

Customer: Okay, got it. What's next? 

Customer Service Agent: Once the app is updated, you'll need to sign into your Contoso Wireless account using your username and password. After that, you'll be able to access our streaming services and start watching movies right away! 

Customer: Great! That sounds easy enough. Is there anything else I should know before I get started? 

Customer Service Agent: Yes, just one more thing! To make sure that your streaming experience is as smooth as possible, we recommend connecting to a Wi-Fi network whenever possible. This will help ensure that you don't experience any buffering or other issues while streaming movies or other content on our service. 

Customer: Got it! Thanks for the help - I think I'm all set now. 

Customer Service Agent: My pleasure! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
