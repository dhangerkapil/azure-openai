Agent: Hi, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the issue?

Customer: Well, the internet speed has been really slow lately and I'm wondering if there's something wrong with my connection.

Agent: Let me take a look at your account and see what I can do to help. Could you please provide me with your account number?

Customer: Sure, here it is [account number]. 

Agent: Thanks for that. I'm just checking your account now and it looks like your plan includes 10 Mbps download speeds. Are you seeing slower than that? 

Customer: Yes, definitely. It's been really slow for a few weeks now and I'm considering switching to another provider. 

Agent: I understand your frustration and I want to help you get the best experience possible with Contoso Wireless. Let me see what I can do to help improve your connection speed. 

Customer: That would be great! 

Agent: Okay, let me just check a few things first before we get started. Is this issue happening on all of your devices or just one? 

Customer: It's happening on all of them. 

Agent: Alright, thanks for letting me know that. In order to try and improve your connection speed, we'll need to make some adjustments on our end first. Would you like me to proceed with this or would you prefer to switch providers? 

Customer: No, no, it's okay. Go ahead and make the adjustments first and then we can see if that helps improve my connection speed before I decide whether or not to switch providers. 

Agent: Sure thing! I'm going to go ahead and make some adjustments on our end now and then once those have been completed, we can check the speeds again and see if that has improved anything.  Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should be all for now. Thanks for all your help!
