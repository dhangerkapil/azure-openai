Customer Service Agent:

Hello and welcome to Contoso Wireless. How may I help you? 

Customer:

Hi, I'm having a problem with your product streaming service. It's been buffering and lagging, and I'm not able to watch anything properly. Can you help me? 

Customer Service Agent:

I apologize for the inconvenience you are experiencing. Let me take a look into this for you. Can you tell me what device you are using to stream? 

Customer: 

I'm using an iPhone XS. 

Customer Service Agent: 

Ok, great. Let's start by checking the connection speed on your device. Can you please go to your Settings > Wi-Fi and check what connection speed is showing? 

Customer: 

It says I'm connected at 25 Mbps. 

Customer Service Agent: 

That should be more than enough for streaming our content. Have you tried restarting your device? That may help with the buffering issue. 

Customer: 

Yes, I've restarted it multiple times but it hasn't helped. What else can I do? 

 Customer Service Agent: 

 We understand that this is frustrating, and we want to help get this resolved for you as quickly as possible. Can you please try resetting your router or modem by unplugging it from the power source for at least 10 seconds and then plugging it back in? This should help reset the connection and get your streaming working again. 

 Customer: 

 Alright, I'll give that a try. Is there anything else I can do if that doesn't work?

 Customer Service Agent:

 If resetting the router does not resolve the issue, then we suggest that you contact your internet service provider to see if there are any problems with your internet connection or if they can provide any additional support in resolving this issue. Additionally, we suggest that you update your streaming app to the latest version as this could also help improve the performance of our product streaming service.
