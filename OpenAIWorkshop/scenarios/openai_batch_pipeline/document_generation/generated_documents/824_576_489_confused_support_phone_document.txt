Customer: Hi, I'm trying to figure out why my Contoso Wireless phone isn't working. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi there! I'd be more than happy to help you with your Contoso Wireless phone. What seems to be the problem?

Customer: Well, I was trying to make a call and it just wouldn't connect. I tried restarting it and nothing changed.

Agent: Okay, no problem. Let's see if we can get to the bottom of this. Could you tell me what type of phone you have?

Customer: It's a Contoso Wireless Galaxy 5S.

Agent: Alright, thank you for that information. Is your phone still not connecting when you try to make a call?

Customer: No, it just won't connect. The screen shows that the call is dialing, but then nothing happens. 

Agent: Alright, let's try a few troubleshooting steps first before we move on to more advanced solutions. Could you please check if your data connection is enabled? 

Customer: Yes, it is enabled. 

Agent: Great! Can you please check if your phone has the latest software update installed? 

Customer: Yes, I checked and it does have the latest software update installed. 

Agent: Okay, thank you for that information. Have you tried clearing the cache of your phone? 

Customer: No, I haven't tried that yet. How do I do that? 

Agent: Sure thing! Clearing the cache is easy and will only take a few minutes of your time. First, go to your settings menu and select "Storage". Then select "Cached Data" and press "OK" to clear the cache. After that, restart your phone and try making a call again. 

Customer: Okay, I'll try that now and let you know if it works. 

Agent: Sounds great! If clearing the cache doesn't work, we can look into more advanced solutions such as replacing your SIM card or resetting your network settings. But let's give clearing the cache a try first and see if that fixes the issue for you. 

Customer: Alright, thank you for all of your help so far! I'll let you know if clearing the cache works or not.
