Customer: "I just bought a new phone from Contoso Wireless and I'm already having issues with it! I need to speak with someone about my account!"

Agent: "Hello, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?"

Customer: "I bought a new phone from you and it's not working. I want to know what's going on with my account!"

Agent: "I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please tell me more about the issue you are experiencing with your phone?"

Customer: "It won't turn on and the screen is completely blank. It's been like this since I got it."

Agent: "I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Can you please provide me with your account information so that I can take a look at it?" 

Customer: "Yeah, my account number is 1234-5678-90. Can you please help me figure out what's wrong with my phone?" 

Agent: "Yes, of course. Let me take a look at your account and see what might be causing the issue. Please hold while I do that." 

[Pause] 

Agent: "Alright, after taking a look at your account, it looks like there may have been an issue with the activation process when you first set up your phone. I suggest we try reactivating your device to see if that resolves the issue." 

Customer: "That sounds good, but why wasn't this caught before I left the store? This is really inconvenient and I don't want to have to come back in again." 

Agent: "I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. We strive to ensure that all of our customers are satisfied with their purchase and we sincerely regret that this was not the case for you. We'll do our best to make sure that this is taken care of as quickly as possible so that you don't have to come back in again."
