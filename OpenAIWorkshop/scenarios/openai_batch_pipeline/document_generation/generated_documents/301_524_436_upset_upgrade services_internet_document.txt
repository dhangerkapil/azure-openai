Hello, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm really frustrated. I'm trying to upgrade my internet service, but it's been a nightmare. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent:

Good afternoon! I apologize for the inconvenience. How can I help you with your upgrade today?

Customer:

I've been trying to upgrade my internet service for weeks now, but nothing seems to be working. What am I doing wrong?

Customer Service Agent: 

I understand how frustrating this must be. Can you please tell me a bit more about the issue so that I can try to help you better?

Customer: 

Sure. Every time I try to upgrade my internet service, the website tells me there's an error and won't let me proceed. It's been like this for weeks and it's really annoying. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I'm sorry to hear that. Let me take a look at your account and see what might be causing the issue. Can you please confirm your account details for me? 

Customer: 
Sure. My name is [Name], my account number is [Number], and my phone number is [Number]. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Thank you for providing your account details. Please give me a few minutes while I take a look at your account and see what might be causing the issue. 

 Customer: 

 Okay, thank you.

 Customer Service Agent: 

 Alright, I've taken a look at your account and it looks like the issue is due to an outdated browser version. If you could update your browser, that should fix the problem and allow you to upgrade your internet service. Does that make sense?

 Customer: 

 Yes, that makes sense. Is there anything else I need to do? 

 Customer Service Agent: 

 No, once you update your browser, everything should be good to go and you should be able to upgrade your internet service without any issues. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
