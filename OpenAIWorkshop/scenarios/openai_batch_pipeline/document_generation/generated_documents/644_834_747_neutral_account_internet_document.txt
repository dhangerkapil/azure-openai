Agent: Hi there! Iâ€™d be more than happy to help you with your Contoso Wireless internet connection. Could you please provide me with your account number so that I can look into the issue?

Customer: Sure, my account number is XXXXXXXX. 

Agent: Thank you for providing me with your account number. I have pulled up your account and can see that you have an internet plan with Contoso Wireless. Can you please explain what kind of issues you are having? 

Customer: Well, it seems like my internet connection is slow and unreliable. It keeps dropping out and I can't get any work done. 

Agent: I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Can you please confirm the type of device you are using to connect to the internet? 

Customer: Yes, I'm using a laptop with Windows 10 installed. 

Agent: Ok, thank you for confirming the device type. Let me take a look at your account settings and see if there is anything that can be done to improve your connection. Can you please hold while I investigate further? 

Customer: Sure, no problem. 

Agent: Alright, thank you for holding. After looking at your account settings, it appears that your internet plan does not include enough bandwidth to support the number of devices connected to the network. To improve your connection speed and reliability, I suggest upgrading to a higher tier plan with more bandwidth. Would this be something you would like to do? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great. Can you tell me more about the different plans available and what kind of speeds and bandwidth they offer? 

Agent: Absolutely! We currently have three different tiers of plans available - basic, standard, and premium. The basic plan offers up to 25 Mbps download speed and up to 5 Mbps upload speed with 10 GB of data usage per month. The standard plan offers up to 50 Mbps download speed and up to 10 Mbps upload speed with 20 GB of data usage per month. Lastly, the premium plan offers up to 100 Mbps download speed and up to 20 Mbps upload speed with 50 GB of data usage per month. Would any of these plans work for you? 

Customer: Yes, the standard plan sounds like it would work best for me since I need a bit more bandwidth than what the basic plan offers but not as much as what the premium plan offers. Can you tell me more about how much this plan will cost me? 

Agent: Sure! The standard plan costs $59 per month and comes with unlimited data usage after 20GB has been used up each month. In addition, this plan includes 24/7 customer service support as well as access to our online tools such as our mobile app which allows customers to manage their account from anywhere in the world. Does this sound like something that would work for you? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds great! How do I go about signing up for this plan? 

Agent: Signing up for this plan is easy! All you need to do is log into your Contoso Wireless account or create one if you don't already have one, select the Standard Plan option from the dropdown menu, enter in your payment information, and then click submit. Once we receive your payment information we will process your request and activate your new Standard Plan within 24 hours. Does this sound okay? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds great! Thank you for all of your help!
