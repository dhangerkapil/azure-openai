Customer:

Hello, I recently purchased a Contoso Wireless phone and I am having some serious issues with it. Can someone please help me?

Agent:

Good afternoon, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. We apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced. How can we assist you today?

Customer:

Well, the phone won't turn on and I'm not sure why. I've tried restarting it multiple times but nothing seems to be working.

Agent:

I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what kind of phone model you purchased? This information will help us troubleshoot the issue further. 

Customer: 
Yes, it's a Contoso Model 4G. 

Agent: 
Thank you for the information. Can you tell me when the problem first began? Was there any change in the environment before the phone stopped working? 

Customer: 
The problem started about a week ago after I updated the software on the phone. The phone was working perfectly fine before that, so I'm not sure why it suddenly stopped working. 

Agent: 
I see. We suggest restarting your device after updating its software as this could help resolve any potential issues that may arise. Have you tried restarting your device since the update? 

Customer: 
Yes, I have already tried restarting it multiple times but nothing seems to be working. 

Agent: 
In this case, we suggest trying a factory reset on your device as this should restore your device to its original settings and may resolve any issues with the software update. Can you try performing a factory reset on your device and let us know if that helps? 

Customer: 
Yes, I can try that. How do I perform a factory reset on my Contoso phone? 

Agent: 
You can perform a factory reset on your Contoso Phone by going to Settings > Backup & Reset > Factory Data Reset > Reset Phone > Erase Everything. Please note that performing a factory reset will delete all data from your device so please ensure that you back up any important data before proceeding with the reset. After performing the reset, please try turning on your device and let us know if this helps resolve the issue.
