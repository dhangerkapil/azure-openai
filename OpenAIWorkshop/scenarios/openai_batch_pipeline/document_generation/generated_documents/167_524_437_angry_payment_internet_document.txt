Customer: "I just got my bill from Contoso Wireless and I am furious! It looks like you guys charged me for internet service, but I never ordered it!"

Agent: "I apologize for the confusion. Could you please provide me with your account information so that I can look into this further?"

Customer: "My account number is 1234567. I want to know why I was charged for something I didn't order."

Agent: "Thank you for providing your account information. I'm looking into this now. Please give me one moment to review your account." 

Customer: "I don't understand why I was charged for something I didn't order. This is unacceptable!" 

Agent: "I understand your frustration and apologize for the inconvenience. Let me see if I can help explain what happened. From what I can tell, it looks like you were charged for a month of internet service that was added to your account on April 15th." 

Customer: "That's impossible! I never added internet service to my account. How did this happen?" 

Agent: "It looks like the internet service was added as part of a promotional offer that was sent out to customers who have been with Contoso Wireless for more than 3 years. Since you qualify for the promotion, we added the internet service to your account automatically." 

Customer: "That's still not acceptable. Why wasn't I informed about this before it was added to my account? And why am I being charged for something I didn't even order?" 

Agent: "I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused you. The promotional offer should have included information about the addition of the internet service and the cost associated with it. However, since you weren't aware of this, we will be happy to refund you for the cost of the internet service and remove it from your account." 

Customer: "That's much better. Thank you for taking care of this issue." 

Agent: "You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
