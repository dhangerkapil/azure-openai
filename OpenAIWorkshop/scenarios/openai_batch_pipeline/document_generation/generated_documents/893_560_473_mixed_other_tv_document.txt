Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a new Contoso Wireless TV, and I'm having some trouble setting it up. Is there any way you can help me?

Agent: Absolutely. What kind of trouble are you having?

Customer: Well, I'm not sure how to get the TV connected to the internet.

Agent: No problem. Can you tell me a little bit more about the TV? What model is it?

Customer: It's a Contoso Wireless 55 inch 4K HD Smart TV. 

Agent: Okay, great. Do you have a router that is compatible with the TV?

Customer: Yes, I do. It's a dual-band wireless router with 802.11ac technology. 

Agent: Perfect! To get your TV connected to the internet, we will need to set up the Wi-Fi connection. First, make sure that your router is turned on and that it is broadcasting a signal. Then, on your TV, go to Settings > Network > Wireless Setup and select your router from the list of available networks. You will then be prompted to enter your Wi-Fi password. Once you have entered the password, your TV should be connected to the internet. 

Customer: That makes sense. Thank you for walking me through this process! Is there anything else I should know before I begin? 

Agent: Yes, make sure that your router is up to date with the latest firmware and that you have enabled WPA2 security settings on it as well. This will help ensure that your connection is secure and stable. 

Customer: Got it! Anything else? 

Agent: Yes, once your TV is connected to the internet, make sure that you enable automatic software updates so that you can stay up-to-date with all of our new features and bug fixes. You can find this setting in Settings > Network > Software Updates. 

Customer: Alright, sounds good! I'll go ahead and get started with setting up my Wi-Fi connection now. Thanks for all of your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! If you have any other questions or issues while setting up your TV, please don't hesitate to reach out to us again. Have a great day!
