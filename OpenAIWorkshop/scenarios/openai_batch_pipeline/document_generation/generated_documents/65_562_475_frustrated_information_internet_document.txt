Customer: Hi, I'm having a problem with my internet. I'm getting really slow speeds and my connection keeps dropping. Can you help?

Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that. We'll do our best to help you get your internet running smoothly. Could you tell me more about the issue you're experiencing?

Customer: Well, like I said, my connection is really slow and it keeps dropping. I've already checked all the cables and restarted my router but it's still happening. 

Agent: That sounds very frustrating. Can you please provide me with more information? What kind of speeds are you getting when the connection is working?

Customer: When it's working, I'm getting around 3 Mbps down and 0.5 Mbps up. But that's only when it's working, which isn't very often. 

Agent: Thank you for that information. Can you please provide me with your account details so I can take a look at what's going on? 

Customer: Sure, my account number is 123456789. 

Agent: Great, thank you for providing that information. Let me take a look at your account and see what we can do to help you get your internet running smoothly again. 

Customer: Okay, great. 

Agent: Alright, after taking a look at your account, it looks like your internet service is not set up properly and needs to be adjusted in order to work correctly. We can do this remotely or if you'd like we can send out a technician to your house to make the adjustments in person. What would you prefer? 

Customer: Remotely would be better for me since I'm not home very often. 

Agent: No problem, we can do that for you! Let me just go ahead and make the necessary adjustments so that your internet will start working properly again. Please bear with me as this might take a few minutes to complete. 

Customer: Alright, thank you for helping me out! 

Agent: You're welcome! It should only take a few minutes before your internet is back up and running smoothly again. In the meantime, please feel free to let me know if there is anything else I can help you with today!
