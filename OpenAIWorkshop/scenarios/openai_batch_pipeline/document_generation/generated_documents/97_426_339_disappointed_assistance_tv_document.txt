Agent: Hello, and thank you for reaching out to Contoso Wireless! I apologize that you are having difficulty with your new TV. How can I help? 

Customer: Well, I'm trying to connect it to my Wi-Fi network, but it won't accept my password. 

Agent: I understand your frustration. Can you please provide me with more information regarding the issue? 

Customer: Sure. I've tried connecting the TV multiple times and each time it just tells me that my password is incorrect. 

Agent: I see. Do you remember if you had typed in the correct password each time? 

Customer: Yes, I'm certain that I entered the correct password every time. 

Agent: Alright, then let's try to reset the TV and see if that helps. Can you please turn off the power and unplug the TV from the wall outlet? Once you do that, can you please plug it back in and turn it on? 

Customer: Okay, I've done that. 

Agent: Great! Now let's try connecting it to your Wi-Fi network again. Can you please enter your Wi-Fi password again and see if that works? 

Customer: Alright, I'll give it a shot. 

Agent: If you still encounter the same issue, please let me know so we can try other solutions such as resetting your router or trying a different network connection.
