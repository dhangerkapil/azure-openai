Customer Service Agent: Hi there, thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. How can I help you?

Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a streaming product from your company and I'm having some trouble setting it up. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! What kind of issues are you having?

Customer: Well, the instructions that came with the product are confusing and I'm not sure how to connect it to my WiFi network.

Customer Service Agent: No problem, let's take a look. Could you please tell me what type of streaming product you have? 

Customer: It's a Contoso Ultra 4K Streaming Player. 

Customer Service Agent: Great! That should be easy to get set up. Do you know your WiFi network name and password? 

Customer: Yes, I do. 

Customer Service Agent: Excellent. Let's start by connecting the device to your WiFi network. First, press the power button on the back of the device to turn it on. Then, using the remote control, select "Settings" from the main menu. Next, select "Network Settings" and then choose "Wireless". You will be prompted to enter your network name and password. Once that's done, press "Connect" and the device should be connected to your WiFi network. 

Customer: Ok, got it. Thanks for the help! 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: Actually yes - once I'm connected to my WiFi network, how do I set up streaming services like Netflix or Hulu? 

Customer Service Agent: Sure thing! Once you're connected to your WiFi network, select "Settings" from the main menu again and then choose "Streaming Services". Here you'll be able to add or remove streaming services as desired. Simply select which services you'd like to add or remove and follow the on-screen instructions for each service. Once you've finished setting up your services, press the back button twice to return to the main menu and start streaming! 

Customer: Got it - thanks again for all your help! 

Customer Service Agent: No problem at all - happy streaming! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

 Customer: No, that's all - thank you!
