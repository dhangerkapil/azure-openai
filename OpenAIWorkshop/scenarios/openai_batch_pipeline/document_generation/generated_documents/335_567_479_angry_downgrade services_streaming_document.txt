Hello, this is [Name], a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer:
I'm very angry! I just downgraded my services and now I'm not getting the product streaming I was promised. What's going on?

Customer Service Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience. Could you please explain to me what happened so that I can better understand the issue? 

Customer:
Yes, I recently downgraded my services from the premium plan to the basic plan. I was told that I would still get access to the product streaming, but it hasn't been working. 

Customer Service Agent:
I see. Could you tell me what type of device you are using and how you are accessing the product streaming? 

Customer:
I'm using an iPhone and trying to access it through the Contoso Wireless app. 

Customer Service Agent:
Alright, let me take a look into this for you. Can you please confirm your account details such as your name, phone number, and address? 

Customer:
Yes, my name is [Name], my phone number is [phone number], and my address is [address]. 

Customer Service Agent:
Thank you for providing that information. Let me check your account and see if there are any discrepancies that may be causing this issue. 

Customer: 
Ok, thank you. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I have checked your account and it appears that when you downgraded your plan, it did not include access to the product streaming as part of the basic plan package. If you would like to upgrade back to the premium plan, then you will be able to access the product streaming again. 

Customer: 
But why wasn't I told about this when I downgraded? That's not fair! 

 Customer Service Agent: 
I apologize for any confusion caused by this situation. We understand how frustrating this can be and we want to make sure our customers are always informed about their service plans. To ensure this doesn't happen again in the future, we will make sure that our customer service representatives provide more detailed information when customers downgrade their plans. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
