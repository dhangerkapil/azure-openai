Agent: Hi there, I'm happy to help you out with that. What kind of information would you like to know?

Customer: Well, I'm curious about your product streaming services. Can you tell me more about that?

Agent: Absolutely! Product streaming is our way of providing customers with access to the latest products and updates from Contoso Wireless. With product streaming, customers can easily keep up-to-date with our products and services without having to go through the hassle of manual updates or downloads. 

Customer: That sounds great! How does it work?

Agent: Sure! Product streaming works by automatically downloading and installing any new updates or products to your device. This means that you won't have to worry about manually downloading or installing anything - all you have to do is connect your device to the internet and the product streaming service will take care of the rest. 

Customer: That's very convenient. Is there a fee associated with this service? 

Agent: No, there is no fee associated with product streaming. It is included in all Contoso Wireless packages and can be enabled or disabled at any time. 

Customer: That's great news! Are there any other benefits associated with product streaming? 

Agent: Yes! Not only does product streaming make sure that you are always up-to-date with the latest products and services from Contoso Wireless, but it also helps reduce the amount of data you use on your device since the updates are downloaded over a secure connection. This means that you can save on your data usage while still enjoying all the benefits of our products and services. 

Customer: That's really useful information. Is there anything else I should know about product streaming? 

Agent: Yes, it's important to note that product streaming is not available for all devices. Some older devices may not be compatible with the service so it's best to check before enabling it on your device. Also, while product streaming is included in all Contoso Wireless packages, you may need to purchase additional data plans if you plan on using the service regularly. 

Customer: Okay, that's helpful to know. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything about product streaming to me!
