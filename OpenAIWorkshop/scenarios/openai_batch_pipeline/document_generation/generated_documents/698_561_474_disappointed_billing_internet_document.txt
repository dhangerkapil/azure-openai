Agent: Hi there! I apologize for the inconvenience you are experiencing. Can you tell me a bit more about the problem you are having?

Customer: Sure, I signed up for your internet service and was expecting to get a certain speed, but I'm not getting that. I don't understand why this is happening.

Agent: That doesn't sound right. Can you please provide me with your account information so that I can look into this further?

Customer: Sure, here is my account number: XXXXXXX. 

Agent: Thank you for providing your account information. Please allow me a few moments while I review your account and investigate the issue further. 

Customer: Ok, no problem. 

Agent: After reviewing your account, it appears that you have signed up for our standard internet service which provides speeds of up to 10 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload. It looks like you are currently receiving 7 Mbps download and 0.5 Mbps upload. This is within the expected range of speeds provided by our standard internet service, so it appears to be working correctly. 

Customer: But that's not what I was expecting! I was told that I would be getting speeds of up to 25 Mbps download and 5 Mbps upload with this plan! 

Agent: I apologize for any confusion caused by this discrepancy. We do offer an upgrade to our high-speed internet service which provides speeds of up to 25 Mbps download and 5 Mbps upload. Would you like to upgrade your plan to this higher speed? 

Customer: Yes, please! How much will it cost? 

Agent: The cost for upgrading to our high-speed internet service is $30 per month in addition to your current monthly bill amount. Is this something you would like to proceed with? 

Customer: Yes, please go ahead and upgrade my plan! 

Agent: Great! Your plan has been upgraded and you should now be able to experience the higher speeds that come with our high-speed internet service. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
