Customer: Hi, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I was wondering if you could help me with a billing question.

Agent: Absolutely! What can I help you with?

Customer: I recently bought a phone from your company and wanted to know if there were any discounts available for returning customers.

Agent: Yes, absolutely! We offer 10% off for returning customers. All you have to do is enter the code RETURN10 at checkout and you'll get the discount.

Customer: That's great! Is there anything else I should know about the product phone?

Agent: Sure! The product phone has a 5.5 inch HD display, dual rear cameras, and an 8-core processor. It also comes with 64GB of storage, which can be expanded up to 128GB with an SD card. Plus, it has a long-lasting battery so you won't have to worry about running out of juice in the middle of the day. 

Customer: That sounds great! What about warranty? Is there any kind of warranty included with the phone? 

Agent: Yes, there is a one-year warranty included with the phone. It covers all manufacturer defects and any issues that may arise within the first year of use. 

Customer: That's really helpful. What about the billing process? How does that work? 

Agent: Sure! We offer several different payment options for our customers. You can pay for your purchase in full at checkout or choose to spread out your payments over several months. We also accept major credit cards, PayPal, and Apple Pay as payment methods. 

Customer: That's great! Is there any way to track my payments? 

Agent: Absolutely! Once you've made your purchase, you'll be able to log into your account online or on our mobile app to track your payments and manage your billing information. You'll also receive email notifications when your payment is due or if there are any changes to your account. 

Customer: Perfect! That's all I needed to know - thank you for all your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
