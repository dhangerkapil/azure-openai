Customer: Hi, I recently purchased a phone from your company and I am having some trouble with it. 

Customer Service Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of trouble are you having with the phone?

Customer: Well, I've had the phone for a couple weeks now and it keeps freezing up on me. It also randomly shuts down and won't turn back on until I plug it in and wait for a while. 

Customer Service Agent: That does sound like a problem. Can you please describe what type of phone you have? 

Customer: Yes, I bought the Contoso Wireless Phone 7 model. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, thank you for that information. We will need to troubleshoot this issue and see what the problem is. Can I get your name and contact information so we can reach out to you? 

Customer: Sure, my name is John Smith and my number is 555-123-4567. 

Customer Service Agent: Great, thank you for that information John. We will have someone contact you shortly regarding your issue. In the meantime, is there anything else that I can help you with? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thanks for your help. 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day!
