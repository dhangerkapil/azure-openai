Customer Service Agent: Welcome to Contoso Wireless, how may I help you today?

Customer: Hi, I'm not happy with your service. I bought a streaming product from your company and it's been terrible.

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. Can you tell me more about the issue?

Customer: Yes, the streaming product is constantly buffering and the video quality is terrible. It's not even close to what was advertised.

Customer Service Agent: I understand how frustrating this must be for you. We take customer satisfaction very seriously and we want to make sure that you are happy with our services. Let me look into this further for you and see what can be done. Can I please have your account information so that I can look into this further?

Customer: Sure, my account number is [REDACTED].

Customer Service Agent: Thanks for that information. Give me one moment while I look into this further for you. 

[Customer Service Agent looks into the issue] 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, I have looked into this further and it appears that there may be an issue with your internet connection or router settings that is causing the buffering and poor video quality issues. Can you please try restarting your router and if that doesn't work, please contact your internet service provider to check if there is an issue with your connection? 

Customer: That's really disappointing. I had no issues before buying this product from Contoso Wireless. 

Customer Service Agent: I understand how disappointing this must be for you, but unfortunately it does appear to be an issue with your internet connection or router settings. We want to make sure that you are satisfied with our services so let me offer you a one-time discount on a future purchase from Contoso Wireless as a way of apologizing for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Would that be acceptable? 

Customer: That would be great, thank you. 

Customer Service Agent: Not a problem at all! I'll go ahead and add the discount to your account now. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should be all for now. Thank you for your help. 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! If there is anything else we can do to help, please don't hesitate to reach out again. Have a great day!
