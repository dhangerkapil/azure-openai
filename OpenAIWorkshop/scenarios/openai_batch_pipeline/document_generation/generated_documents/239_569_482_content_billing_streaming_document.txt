Agent: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Could you tell me a bit more about what kind of issues you're having?

Customer: Well, I'm not sure how much I'm being charged for the streaming service. Can you explain that to me?

Agent: Absolutely! Contoso Wireless offers two different plans for our streaming service - a basic plan and a premium plan. The basic plan is $9.99/month and includes access to our library of on-demand content and up to two simultaneous streams. The premium plan is $14.99/month and includes access to our library of on-demand content, up to four simultaneous streams, as well as access to exclusive content not available on the basic plan. 

Customer: That makes sense. But if I have the premium plan, will I be charged extra for additional streams? 

Agent: No, you won't be charged extra for additional streams on the premium plan. However, if you exceed four simultaneous streams at any given time, then we may need to ask you to upgrade your plan. 

Customer: Okay, so what about taxes? Will I be charged extra for taxes on my subscription? 

Agent: Yes, taxes may apply depending on where you are located. Taxes will appear on your bill as separate line items and may vary by state or country. 

Customer: Alright, so how often am I billed for the subscription? 

Agent: You will be billed once per month on the same date that you initially signed up for your subscription. If you need to change your billing date or payment method at any time, please contact us and we'll be happy to help. 

Customer: Great, that's very helpful! Is there anything else I should know about billing? 

Agent: Yes, we offer several different payment methods including credit card, PayPal, and direct debit from your bank account. We also accept gift cards from certain retailers as well as payment through Apple Pay or Google Pay. Lastly, if you ever have any questions or concerns about your billing statement or subscription plan, please don't hesitate to contact us and we'll be happy to assist you.
