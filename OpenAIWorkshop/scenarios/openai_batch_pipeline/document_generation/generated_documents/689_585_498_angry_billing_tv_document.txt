"I'm so angry with Contoso Wireless right now! I've been trying to figure out why I'm being charged for a TV that I never ordered, and no one can help me! I'm done playing around - what's going on?!"

Agent: 
"I apologize for the frustration you are experiencing, and I am here to help. Can you please tell me what the issue is so I can help you better?"

Customer: 
"I got my bill yesterday and it included a charge for a TV that I didn't order. It was listed as an add-on to my plan, but I never agreed to it. What is this all about?"

Agent: 
"I apologize for any confusion. It looks like there was an error in our system when your plan was updated recently. We accidentally added the TV as an add-on to your plan. We will be more than happy to remove the charge and issue you a refund for the amount you were charged."

Customer: 
"That's not good enough! How can you make sure this doesn't happen again? I'm not paying for something I didn't even order!"

Agent: 
"I understand your concern, and we take this very seriously. We have already taken steps to make sure this doesn't happen again by improving our system processes. Additionally, we are going to review your account history to make sure no other erroneous charges have been applied."

Customer: 
"That's still not enough - how can I be sure that I won't get charged for something again that I didn't order? This is really unacceptable!"

Agent: 
"We understand how upsetting this situation is, and we are doing our best to make sure it doesn't happen again. In addition to the measures we have already taken, we will be sending you a monthly statement of your account activity so that you can review it for any unauthorized charges." 

Customer: 
"That's better, but I still don't feel very secure. What if something else comes up?" 

Agent: 
"If something else does come up in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out to us right away so that we can investigate the issue and make sure it gets resolved quickly. We value your business and want to make sure that you are always satisfied with our services."
