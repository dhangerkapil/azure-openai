Customer: Hi, I'm having a problem with my bill.

Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that. How can I help?

Customer: I'm getting charged for a TV that I don't even have. What is going on?

Agent: Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on. Can you provide me with your account number?

Customer: Sure, it's 1234567890. 

Agent: Thank you. It looks like you are being charged for a Contoso Wireless TV package. Is this something you requested? 

Customer: No, I never asked for a TV package. 

Agent: Hmm, let me see if I can find out what happened here. Can you give me one moment? 

Customer: Sure. 

Agent: Alright, it looks like this was an error on our end. We accidentally added the TV package to your account when it should not have been added. We apologize for the inconvenience and will be removing the charges from your account immediately. 

Customer: That's great, thank you for fixing this so quickly. But why did this happen in the first place? 

Agent: We are not sure why this happened but we are looking into it to make sure it doesn't happen again in the future. We apologize again for the inconvenience and thank you for bringing it to our attention so we could fix it right away.
