Customer: Hi, I'm not happy with the service I'm receiving from Contoso Wireless. My phone has been having problems since I got it and I haven't been able to get any help.

Agent: Hi there, I apologize for any inconvenience you have experienced. Can you tell me more about the issue you are having with your phone?

Customer: Yeah, my phone has been randomly shutting off and restarting, and I can't seem to figure out why. I've tried to contact customer service but no one seems to be able to help me.

Agent: I understand your frustration. We take our customer service very seriously and I apologize that you haven't been able to get the help you need. Can you tell me a bit more about the phone? What model is it and when did you purchase it?

Customer: It's an iPhone 7 Plus, and I purchased it about three months ago.

Agent: Ok, thank you for that information. Can you tell me what steps you've already taken to try to resolve the issue?

Customer: Yes, I've tried resetting the phone, restoring it from a backup, and even reinstalling the software, but nothing has worked so far.

Agent: Alright, that's good information. Let me see if there's something else we can do to help. Can you please wait while I look into this further? 

Customer: Sure. 

Agent: Great. After looking into this further, it looks like there may be an issue with your phone's hardware or software that needs to be addressed. We can either repair or replace your phone depending on what the issue is. Would you like us to repair or replace it?
