Customer: "What is wrong with Contoso Wireless's internet service? I'm so angry right now!"

Agent: "I apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with our internet service. Can you tell me more about the issue you are having?"

Customer: "It's been down all day! I need to be able to access the internet and this has been a nightmare. What are you going to do about it?"

Agent: "I understand your frustration. We take these issues seriously and are doing everything we can to get the service back up as soon as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you."

Customer: "Apology not accepted. I pay a lot of money for this service and it's unacceptable that it's down all day. When will it be fixed?"

Agent: "We're working hard to get the issue resolved as soon as possible. Unfortunately, at this time, we don't have an exact timeline on when the service will be restored."

Customer: "That's not good enough! You should have a better handle on these issues. What kind of customer service is this?!"

Agent: "We apologize for any frustration or inconvenience this has caused you. We are doing our best to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and we appreciate your patience." 

Customer: "I don't want apologies - I want results! What kind of guarantees can you give me that my internet service won't go down again?" 

Agent: "We can't make any guarantees, but we can assure you that we are doing everything we can to ensure our services remain reliable and stable in the future. We value your loyalty and appreciate your understanding during this difficult time." 

Customer: "This is ridiculous. I demand a refund for my internet services!" 

Agent: "I understand your dissatisfaction with our services and I apologize again for any inconvenience this has caused you. We cannot provide refunds at this time, but if you have any other concerns or questions, please let me know and I'll be happy to help."
