Customer: 
"I recently purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and I'm extremely unhappy with the service I've been receiving. The internet has been incredibly slow and it's causing me to miss deadlines at work. I want to upgrade my internet service, but I'm not sure if it's even possible. Can you help me out?"

Agent: 
"I'm sorry to hear that you're not happy with the service you've been receiving. We do offer upgrade services for our customers, so let's see what we can do for you. What kind of internet service do you currently have?"

Customer: 
"I have the basic package that comes with the phone. It's only 2GB of data per month and it's just not enough for me to do my work."

Agent: 
"We understand your situation and would like to help. We offer several upgrade packages, including one that offers 10GB of data per month. This should be more than enough for you to do your work. Would you like to hear more about this package?"

Customer: 
"Yes, please tell me more about it."

Agent: 
"This package includes 10GB of data per month, unlimited text messages, and unlimited minutes for talking. It also includes access to our exclusive Wi-Fi hotspots located throughout the country. Would this be something that interests you?"

Customer: 
"That sounds great! How much does it cost?"

Agent: 
"The 10GB upgrade package is $50 per month. Is this something that you would be interested in signing up for?"

Customer: 
"That sounds reasonable. How do I go about signing up for this package?"

Agent: 
"You can sign up online at our website or over the phone by calling our customer service line. If you have any questions during the process, please don't hesitate to contact us."
