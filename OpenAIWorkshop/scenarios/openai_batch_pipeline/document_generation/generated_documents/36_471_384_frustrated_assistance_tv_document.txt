Hi, I'm having some trouble with my Contoso Wireless TV. Can you help me?

Agent:

Hello there! I'd be happy to help you with your Contoso Wireless TV. What seems to be the issue? 

Customer:

Well, it won't turn on. I've tried all the obvious things, but nothing has worked so far. 

Agent:

I understand. Let's start by making sure that the power cable is securely connected to the wall outlet and to the back of the TV. 

Customer:

Yes, I've done that already and still nothing. 

Agent:

Let's try something else then. Are you using any other cables, such as HDMI or AV cables? If so, please make sure they are securely connected to both the TV and any other device they may be connected to. 

Customer: 
Yes, I am using an HDMI cable and it is securely connected on both ends. 

Agent: 
Ok, great! Now let's check if the TV is set to the correct input source. To do this, press the input button on your Contoso Wireless TV remote control until you get to the correct input source (HDMI). 

 Customer: 
I did that and still nothing is happening. What else can I try? 

 Agent: 

Let's try resetting your Contoso Wireless TV. To do this, press and hold down the power button for 10 seconds and then release it. Then press the power button again and see if your TV turns on. 

 Customer: 
Ok, I'll give that a try! 

 Agent: 

Great! Let me know if this works for you or if you need any additional assistance with your Contoso Wireless TV.
