Hello there! I would be more than happy to assist you with setting up your Contoso Wireless TV. Before we begin, could you please provide me with some additional information?

Customer: 
Yes, of course. I have already gone through the instructions that came with the TV, but I am still having trouble connecting it to the wireless network. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand. Could you please provide me with your model number so that I can check if there are any known issues or updates that need to be applied?

Customer: 
The model number is CWTV-1010. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Thank you for providing me with the model number. Please give me a moment to check if there are any known issues or updates that need to be applied for this model. 

Customer: 
Sure, take your time. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Okay, I have checked and there are no known issues or updates for this model at this time. Could you please provide me with more information regarding the issue you are having? For example, what is the exact error message you are receiving? 

Customer: 
When I try to connect the TV to my wireless network, it says "unable to connect" and then it just disconnects. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand. It sounds like there may be an issue with your wireless router. Could you please confirm what type of router you are using? 

Customer: 
Yes, I am using a Linksys E2500 router. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Okay, thank you for providing me with this information. It is possible that there may be a compatibility issue between your router and the Contoso Wireless TV. Could you please try connecting the TV to a different router or access point to see if the issue persists?
