Hello, my name is [name] and I'm a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer:
I'm so disappointed with the service that Contoso Wireless has provided me. I recently downgraded my services and now I can't even watch TV. What's going on? 

Customer Service Agent:
I'm sorry to hear that you're unhappy with our services. Can you tell me what type of product you're using? 

Customer:
I'm using your Contoso Wireless TV product. 

Customer Service Agent:
Okay, thank you for clarifying. Can you tell me what type of downgrade you made? 

Customer:
Yes, I downgraded from the Ultra HD package to the basic package. 

Customer Service Agent:
I see. It sounds like the downgrade has caused an issue with your ability to watch TV. Unfortunately, when you downgrade your package, some channels may become unavailable due to licensing agreements between networks and Contoso Wireless. 

Customer:
That doesn't make any sense! How am I supposed to know which channels will be available or not? 

Customer Service Agent:
I understand your frustration. We do provide a detailed list of channels that are available in each package on our website. We also have a customer service representative who can assist you with any questions or concerns that you may have about the channels available in each package. 

Customer:
That's still not good enough! I should have been notified that some channels would become unavailable when I downgraded my package. 

Customer Service Agent:
I understand your frustration and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. In order to rectify the situation, I can offer you a one-time credit of $50 towards your next bill as a courtesy for the inconvenience. Would that be acceptable?
