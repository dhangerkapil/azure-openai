Customer: 
"I just bought a Contoso Wireless phone and it's not working properly. I'm really frustrated and I need help."

Agent: 
"I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's see what we can do to get this resolved. Can you tell me a little more about what is happening with your phone?"

Customer: 
"Well, it won't turn on. I've tried charging it but that doesn't seem to help."

Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating this can be. Can you tell me which model of phone you purchased?"

Customer: 
"It's the Contoso Wireless Galaxy S10."

Agent: 
"Alright, thank you for that information. Is there anything else that has been happening with the phone? Any other problems?"

Customer: 
"No, that's the only problem I'm having right now. I just need it to turn on so I can use it."

Agent: 
"I understand. Let me take a look at some troubleshooting steps we can try to get your phone up and running. The first step is to make sure that your phone is fully charged. Have you had it plugged in for a while?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I've had it plugged in for a few hours but nothing is happening." 

Agent: 
"Alright, let's move on to the next step then. Could you try doing a soft reset of your phone? To do this, press and hold down the power button for 10 seconds and then release it. This should restart your phone." 

Customer: 
"Okay, I'll try that now." 

Agent: 
"Let me know if that helps or not and if not, we can move on to other troubleshooting steps. How does that sound?" 

Customer: 
"That sounds great, thank you for your help."
