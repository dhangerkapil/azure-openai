Hello, I'm having a problem with my upgrade services. I recently upgraded my Contoso Wireless streaming plan, but I'm having issues with the product streaming. Is there anything that can be done to help?

Agent:
Hello there! Thank you for contacting Contoso Wireless. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the upgrade services. Can you tell me what kind of issues you are experiencing with the product streaming?

Customer:
Yes, it keeps buffering and skipping. I've tried resetting the router and device, but it hasn't helped. Is there anything else I can do? 

Agent:
I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at this for you. Could you please provide me with the model number of your device so that I can troubleshoot this issue? 

Customer:
Yes, it's the Contoso Wireless HDX-99 model. 

Agent:
Thank you for providing me with this information. Let me run some tests on your device to see if I can identify the issue causing the buffering and skipping. Could you please stay on the line while I investigate further? 

Customer: 
Yes, I'll stay on the line. 

Agent: 
Thank you for your patience. After running a few tests, it appears that your device is not compatible with our streaming plan upgrade services. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that all devices will be compatible with our streaming plans, so we recommend upgrading to a compatible device in order to use our services effectively. 

Customer: 
That's really disappointing. Is there any way to get a refund or credit for my upgrade? 

Agent: 
I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this issue. Unfortunately, we do not offer refunds or credits for upgrade services as these are non-refundable purchases. However, we would be more than happy to provide you with a discount code that you can use to purchase a compatible device at a discounted rate. Would that be of help?
