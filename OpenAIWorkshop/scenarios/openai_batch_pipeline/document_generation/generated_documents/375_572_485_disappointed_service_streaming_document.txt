Customer Service Agent:

Hello, my name is [Name], and I am a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How may I help you today?

Customer:
I'm not happy with the streaming service that I'm getting from Contoso Wireless. The connection is always slow and it keeps buffering. Can you help me with this?

Customer Service Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please tell me more about your issue? What type of device are you using to stream?

Customer:
I'm using an iPhone 8. It's been happening for about a month now and I'm starting to get frustrated.

Customer Service Agent:
I understand your frustration. Let me take a look at your account and see what we can do to help you out. Can I get your account number or phone number so I can access your account information? 

Customer: 
My account number is XXXXXXXXXX and my phone number is XXX-XXX-XXXX. 

Customer Service Agent: 
Thank you for providing that information. Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on with your streaming service. Please give me one moment while I investigate this further. 

[Agent takes a few moments to investigate the issue] 

Customer Service Agent: 
Okay, I've taken a look at your account and it looks like there may be an issue with the signal strength in your area. We have experienced some outages in that region recently which could be causing your streaming issues. We are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible, but in the meantime, I suggest that you try using a different device or move to a different area where the signal strength is stronger. 

Customer: 
That doesn't really help me right now though, does it? I'm paying for a service that isn't working properly and I want it fixed now! 

Customer Service Agent: 
I completely understand how you feel and I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. We are doing our best to resolve this issue as quickly as possible and we will notify you once it has been resolved. In the meantime, we can offer you a free month of service to make up for the disruption in service that you have experienced. Would that be something that interests you?
