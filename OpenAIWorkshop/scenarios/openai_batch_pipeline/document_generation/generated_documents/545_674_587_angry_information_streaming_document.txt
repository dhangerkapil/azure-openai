Hello, I'm calling Contoso Wireless because I need some information about your streaming product. I've been having a lot of issues with it lately and I'm getting really frustrated. Can you help me?

Agent:

Hello, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. I understand that you are having some issues with our streaming product. Let me see if I can help you. Can you please tell me what the issue is?

Customer:

Yes, the issue is that the streaming isn't working properly. It keeps buffering and the video quality is terrible. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps on the website but nothing has worked. This is really annoying and I'm getting very angry about it.

Agent:

I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. Our streaming product should be working properly, so let's try to figure out what's going on. Could you please provide me with more details about the issue? Are you using a particular device to stream or a specific browser?

Customer: 
Yes, I'm using an iPhone 7 and the Safari browser. The connection speed is also fine so that's not the issue either. It's just that every time I try to stream something, it keeps buffering and then eventually stops completely after a few minutes. This has been happening for weeks now and it's really getting on my nerves! 

Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this must be for you. Please bear with me while we try to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. Could you please tell me what type of content are you trying to stream? Is it a movie or a TV show? 

Customer: 
It's mostly movies, but sometimes TV shows too. It doesn't matter what it is though, the problem persists no matter what type of content I try to watch. This is unacceptable and I want it fixed now! 

Agent: 
I understand your frustration and we will do our best to resolve this issue for you as soon as possible. In order to do so, we will need some additional information from you such as your account details and the exact error message that you are receiving when trying to stream content. Could you please provide us with these details? 

Customer: 
Yes, here are my account details and the error message that appears when I try to stream something: "Error code #1234 - Connection lost". Can you please fix this now? 

 Agent: 

Of course, we will do our best to resolve this issue for you as soon as possible. In order to do so, our technical team will need some additional information from you such as your device information and any other relevant details about your account or streaming history. Could you please provide us with these details so that we can investigate further?
