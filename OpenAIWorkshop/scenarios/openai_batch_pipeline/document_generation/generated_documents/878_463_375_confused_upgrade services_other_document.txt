Agent: Of course! Contoso Wireless offers several different upgrade services for our customers. Our most popular option is our "Bring Your Own Device" plan. With this plan, you can bring your own device to Contoso Wireless and receive a discount on your monthly service charges. 

Customer: That sounds great, but what if I don't have a device? 

Agent: Not a problem! We also offer a "Device Purchase" option where you can purchase a device directly from us at an affordable price and get discounts on your monthly service charges. 

Customer: OK, that makes sense. What other options do you have? 

Agent: We also offer an "Upgrade Your Device" option. With this plan, you can upgrade your existing device to a newer model and get discounts on your monthly service charges. 

Customer: So I can bring my own device, buy one from you, or upgrade my current device? 

Agent: That's right! All of these options provide discounts on your monthly service charges. 

Customer: What kind of discounts do I get with each option? 

Agent: The exact discount varies depending on the device and plan you choose, but generally speaking, we offer up to 20% off your monthly service charges with any of these options. 

Customer: That's great! Are there any other upgrade services that Contoso Wireless offers? 

Agent: Yes! We also offer an "Extended Warranty" option for our devices. With this option, you can extend the warranty period of your device so that you are covered for any repairs or replacements for longer than the standard warranty period.
