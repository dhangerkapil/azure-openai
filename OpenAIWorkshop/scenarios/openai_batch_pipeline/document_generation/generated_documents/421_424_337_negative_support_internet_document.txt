Customer: 
"I'm really frustrated. I just bought Contoso Wireless' internet service and it's not working. I can't get online and I need help figuring out what's wrong."

Agent: 
"I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble connecting to the internet. Let me see if I can help you figure out what's going on."

Customer: 
"That would be great! I've already restarted my modem and tried to reset the connection but nothing seems to be working."

Agent: 
"Let's try a few other things. First, can you confirm that your modem is connected properly to the wall outlet and that all cables are securely in place?"

Customer: 
"Yes, everything is connected correctly."

Agent: 
"Alright, let's try resetting your modem again. Can you please unplug it from the wall outlet and then plug it back in after 30 seconds?"

Customer: 
"Sure, I'll give it a try." 

Agent: 
"Please let me know if that works. If it doesn't, we may need to take a look at your router settings."

Customer: 
"Okay, I'll let you know. But what if that doesn't work either? Is there anything else I can do?" 

Agent: 
"If resetting your modem doesn't work, we can have a technician come to your home to check out the issue in person. That way, they can make sure that your router settings are correct and that everything is working properly."
