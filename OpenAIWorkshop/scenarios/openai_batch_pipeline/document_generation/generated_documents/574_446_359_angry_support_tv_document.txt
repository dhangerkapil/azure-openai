Agent: "I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. We understand that this is a very frustrating experience. We are here to help you in any way we can." 

Customer: "Help me? It doesn't work! How can you help me when the product isn't working?" 

Agent: "First, let's try and determine why the TV is not working. Can you tell me what happened when you first attempted to turn it on?" 

Customer: "Well, I plugged it in and turned it on. The power light came on but nothing else happened. No picture or sound." 

Agent: "Ok, I see. It sounds like you may be having an issue with the power supply. Is it possible for you to check the power cord and make sure that it is securely connected to the wall outlet and the back of the TV?" 

Customer: "Yes, I checked that already but it's still not working." 

Agent: "I understand your frustration, sir. It may be helpful if you can provide us with more details about the TV such as the model number or serial number so that we can look into this issue further." 

Customer: "Sure, here's the model number: XYZ12345." 

Agent: "Thank you for providing that information. We will look into this issue and get back to you as soon as possible with a resolution. In the meantime, please feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns."
