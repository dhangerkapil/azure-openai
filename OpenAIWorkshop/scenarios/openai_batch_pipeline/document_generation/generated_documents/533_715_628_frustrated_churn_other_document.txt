Customer: "Hello, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm very frustrated. I'm thinking about churning and switching to another provider. What other options do you have for me?"

Agent: "Hi there! I understand that you're feeling frustrated. We'd hate to see you go! Could you tell me more about what's making you consider switching providers?"

Customer: "Well, the service isn't very reliable and the customer service is even worse. It's like no one is willing to help me out when I need it."

Agent: "I apologize for your experience with our customer service team. We strive to provide excellent service and are always available to help. Is there something specific that we can do to help keep you as a customer?"

Customer: "Yes, actually. I'd like to know what other products or services Contoso Wireless offers. Are there any alternatives to the current plan I'm on?"

Agent: "Absolutely! We offer a variety of plans, from basic to premium. We also have some great add-ons such as international calling, data packages, and more. Would you like to know more about any of these options?"

Customer: "Yes, please. What are the differences between the basic and premium plans?"

Agent: "The basic plan offers unlimited talk, text, and data up to 1GB of high speed data while the premium plan offers unlimited talk, text, and up to 5GB of high speed data. Additionally, with the premium plan you'll get access to exclusive offers and discounts."

Customer: "That sounds great. What about add-ons? Are there any that would be beneficial for me?" 

Agent: "Yes, we have several add-ons available for both plans. For example, our international calling add-on allows you to make international calls at discounted rates. We also have data packages that give you additional high speed data at discounted rates. Do any of these sound interesting?" 

Customer: "Yes, the international calling add-on sounds interesting. What are the rates like?" 

Agent: "The international calling add-on is $10/month and allows you to make international calls at discounted rates. The rates vary depending on which country you are calling but generally range from $0.05 - $0.20 per minute." 

Customer: "That's great! What other options do you have?" 

Agent: "We also have a variety of data packages available ranging from 1GB - 10GB of additional high speed data starting at $5/month. We also have a device protection plan which covers repairs or replacements for your device if it's damaged or stolen for just $5/month." 

Customer: "That sounds like a great deal! I think I'll stick with Contoso Wireless after all."
