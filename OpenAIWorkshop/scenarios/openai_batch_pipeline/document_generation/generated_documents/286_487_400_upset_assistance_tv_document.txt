Customer: 
"I'm really frustrated with Contoso Wireless! I bought a new TV from you guys, and it won't turn on. I'm so upset!"

Agent: 
"I'm sorry to hear that. We want all of our customers to be completely satisfied with their purchase. Can you please tell me more about the issue you are having?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I bought a brand new TV from your store last week and I've been trying to set it up since then. But every time I plug it in and try to turn it on, nothing happens. It's so frustrating!"

Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating this must be. Can you tell me which model of TV you purchased and when you purchased it?"

Customer: 
"I bought a Contoso 55 inch HDTV last week, and like I said, I've been trying to get it to work ever since then."

Agent: 
"Okay, that helps me understand the situation better. Can you please tell me if the power cord is securely connected to the TV? Have you tried different outlets or power sources?"

Customer: 
"Yes, the power cord is securely connected and I've tried different outlets. Nothing seems to work!"

Agent: 
"I understand how frustrating this must be. Is there anything else that you have tried in order to get the TV working?" 

Customer: 
"No, I haven't tried anything else. I'm not sure what else I can do!" 

Agent: 
"It sounds like we may need to replace your TV for you. Would you like me to arrange for a replacement unit for you? We can also arrange for someone to come out and install it for you if needed." 

Customer: 
"That would be great! Thank you so much for all your help."
