Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble understanding my account. Can you help me?

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely. What seems to be the problem?

Customer: I'm not sure if I'm getting the internet speeds that I'm paying for.

Customer Service Agent: Not a problem. Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on. Can I have your account number? 

Customer: Sure, it's 1234567890. 

Customer Service Agent: Thanks for that information. Let me just pull up your account and take a look at the details. 

Customer: Ok great. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, so it looks like you're paying for the fastest internet speed available with us, which is 10 Mbps. Is that correct? 

Customer: Yes, that's right. 

Customer Service Agent: Ok, let me just run some tests on your connection to make sure everything is working properly. Could you please give me a few minutes while I do that? 

Customer: Sure, no problem. 

Customer Service Agent: Thank you for your patience. Ok, so after running the tests it looks like everything is working as expected and you should be getting the full 10 Mbps of speed. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all I needed help with. Thank you for your assistance!
