Customer Service Agent: Hi, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. How may I help you?

Customer: Hi there. I'm having trouble with the product streaming service. Could you help me with that?

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely. Can you tell me what kind of issues you're having?

Customer: Well, I'm not sure exactly. It seems like the stream isn't loading correctly or quickly enough, and I can't get any of the content to play.

Customer Service Agent: Okay, that's definitely something we can help with. Do you know which device you're trying to stream from? 

Customer: Yes, it's an Android device. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let's start by making sure your device is up to date with all its software updates. Can you check if there are any pending updates on your device? 

Customer: Sure, let me just check. 

Customer Service Agent: Great. Please let me know when you have checked and we can move on to the next step. 

Customer: Alright, all my updates are installed and ready to go. 

Customer Service Agent: Perfect. The next thing we can try is clearing the app's cache data. This will reset any settings that could be causing the issue and refresh the app's performance. To do this, go to your device settings > apps > Contoso Wireless > storage > clear cache data. Once this is done, try opening the app again and see if it works better. 

Customer: Ok, I'll give it a shot. 

Customer Service Agent: Great! Let me know if this solves your issue or if you're still having trouble with product streaming after doing this step. 

Customer: Ok, I cleared the cache data but it doesn't seem like it did anything. The stream still isn't loading properly and I can't get any content to play. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, don't worry - we'll figure out what's going on here! Can you tell me what type of internet connection you're using? Is it Wi-Fi or cellular data? 

Customer: It's Wi-Fi. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay great! Let's make sure your connection is strong enough for streaming - try running a speed test to check your connection speed and make sure it meets our minimum requirements for streaming content. Once that's done, try streaming again and see if that helps.
