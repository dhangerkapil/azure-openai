Customer: 
Hello, I'm having some trouble with my Contoso Wireless internet. Can you help me?

Agent: 
Absolutely! I'll be more than happy to help you with your Contoso Wireless internet. Could you please tell me a bit more about what's going on?

Customer: 
Yes, of course. My internet connection keeps dropping out and I'm having trouble connecting to the network. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps but nothing has worked so far.

Agent: 
I see, I'm sorry to hear that. Could you please tell me what type of device you are using to access the Contoso Wireless internet?

Customer: 
I'm using an iPhone 8 Plus.

Agent: 
Okay, thank you for that information. Can you please confirm for me if the issue is happening on all the devices connected to the Contoso Wireless internet or just this one? 

Customer: 
It's only happening on this device. Everything else is working fine. 

Agent: 
Alright, let's try a few things to see if we can get it working properly. First, can you please try resetting your network settings and then reconnecting to the Contoso Wireless network? 

Customer: 
Yes, I'll give that a try. 

Agent: 
Great! Please let me know if that works or not and we can go from there. 

Customer: 
Ok, will do. Thanks for your help!
