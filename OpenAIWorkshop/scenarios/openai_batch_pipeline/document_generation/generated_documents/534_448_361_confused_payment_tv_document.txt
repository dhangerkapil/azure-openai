Customer: Hi, I'm confused. I just bought a Contoso Wireless TV and I'm trying to figure out how to pay for it. Can you help? 

Agent: Absolutely! What kind of payment are you looking to make? We accept major credit cards, bank transfers, and PayPal. 

Customer: I was thinking of using a credit card but I'm not sure if that's the best option. Is there any way to get a discount or something? 

Agent: We do have some special offers and discounts available for customers who purchase our products with a credit card. You can check out our website for more information. 

Customer: Alright, that sounds great. How does it work? 

Agent: If you purchase your Contoso Wireless TV with a credit card, you'll receive an instant 10% discount off the purchase price. You can also take advantage of our 3-month interest free financing option if you qualify. 

Customer: That sounds great! How do I qualify for the financing option? 

Agent: To qualify for the financing option, you'll need to meet certain criteria such as having a minimum credit score of 650 or higher, having an active bank account in good standing, and making regular payments on time for the duration of the loan period. 

Customer: Okay, that makes sense. So if I purchase my Contoso Wireless TV with a credit card, I'll get an instant 10% discount plus the 3-month interest free financing option? 

Agent: That's right! If you decide to use the financing option, you'll be required to make regular payments on time for the duration of the loan period in order to take advantage of the interest free offer.
