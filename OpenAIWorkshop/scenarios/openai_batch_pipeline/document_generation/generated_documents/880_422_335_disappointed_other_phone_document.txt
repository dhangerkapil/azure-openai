Hello there! I'm so sorry to hear you're having issues with your Contoso Wireless phone. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

Customer:
Yes, the phone won't charge properly and the battery is draining too quickly. 

Agent:
I understand how frustrating that must be. Can you tell me what type of phone you have and when you purchased it?

I purchased it about a month ago and it's a Contoso Wireless S20.

Alright, thank you for that information. Can you tell me if you have tried any troubleshooting steps yet? 

Customer: 
Yes, I have tried resetting the phone, using different chargers, and even removing the battery and putting it back in. None of those steps worked. 

Agent: 
I see, that's definitely not a good sign. Can you please send us your serial number so we can look into this further for you?
