Hello, I'm looking for some support regarding the Contoso Wireless TV product. I'm not happy with the service I'm receiving and would like to speak to someone about it.

Agent:
Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a customer service representative at Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today?

Customer:
I've been having problems with my Contoso Wireless TV product. It keeps freezing and I can't get any channels to come in. It's incredibly frustrating.

Agent:
I apologize for the inconvenience you are experiencing. Can you tell me more about what is happening?

Customer:
Yes, it started a few days ago when I noticed that the picture quality was becoming blurry and the channels weren't coming in as clearly as before. Then, it began freezing and I can't get anything to work properly. 

Agent: 
I understand how frustrating this must be for you. To troubleshoot the issue, can you tell me if you have tried restarting the device or resetting the connection? 

Customer: 
Yes, I have tried both of those things and they didn't help. The same problem keeps occurring no matter what I do. 

Agent: 
I see, in this case we may need to take a closer look at your device. Can you please provide us with your device's serial number so that we can run a diagnostic test on it? 

Customer: 
Yes, here is the serial number [XXXXXXXX]. Can you please let me know how long this will take? I'm really frustrated with this product and need it fixed as soon as possible. 

Agent: 
We understand your frustration and will do our best to get your device fixed as soon as possible. The diagnostic test should take about an hour to complete, but we will keep you updated on its progress throughout the process. Once we have completed the test, we can discuss what steps we need to take next in order to resolve your issue.
