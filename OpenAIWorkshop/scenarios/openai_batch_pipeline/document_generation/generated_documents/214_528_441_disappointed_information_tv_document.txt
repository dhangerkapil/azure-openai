Agent: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that. I'll do my best to help you out. What seems to be the problem?

Customer: Well, when I turn it on the picture is distorted and the sound doesn't work at all.

Agent: That sounds like an issue with the hardware. Can you tell me if you've done anything to try and fix it? 

Customer: Yes, I've tried unplugging it and plugging it back in again but that didn't do anything. 

Agent: Alright, let's try a few more troubleshooting steps before we look into returning or exchanging it. Are you able to access the TV menu? 

Customer: Yes, I can access the menu but I don't know what to do next. 

Agent: Let's start by checking for any software updates for the TV. Can you go into the settings menu and look for an option that says 'update'? 

Customer: Yes, I found the option for software updates but when I select it nothing happens. 

Agent: That's strange. Could you please confirm that your TV is connected to a wireless network with a strong signal? 

Customer: Yes, my TV is connected to a wireless network with a strong signal. 

Agent: Okay, let's try another approach then. Could you please confirm that your TV is connected to an HDMI source device such as a Blu-ray player or gaming console? 

Customer: Yes, my TV is connected to an HDMI source device. 

Agent: Great! Now let's try resetting your TV back to its factory settings. To do this, go into the settings menu and look for an option that says 'reset'. Once you have done this, please power off your TV and disconnect it from all devices before powering it back on again. Does this sound okay? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds like something worth trying. Thank you for your help!
