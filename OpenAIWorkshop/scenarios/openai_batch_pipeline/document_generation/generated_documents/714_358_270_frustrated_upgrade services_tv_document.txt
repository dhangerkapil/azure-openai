Agent: Hi there! Yes, I'd be happy to help. What seems to be the issue?

Customer: Well, when I try to upgrade, it just says "Error" and won't go any further.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please provide me with some more information? What model of TV are you trying to upgrade?

Customer: It's a Contoso Wireless Smart TV model number XYZ123.

Agent: Alright, let me check on that for you. One moment please.

(A few moments later)

Agent: Ok, I've done some research and it looks like your TV may be incompatible with the latest Contoso Wireless upgrade. Unfortunately, this is a known issue with some older models and we don't have a fix for it yet. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for your help. 

Agent: You're welcome! If you have any other questions or concerns about Contoso Wireless products or services, please don't hesitate to reach out again. Have a great day!
