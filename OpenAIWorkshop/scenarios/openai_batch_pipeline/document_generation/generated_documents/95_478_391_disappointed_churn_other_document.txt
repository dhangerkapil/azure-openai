Customer Service Agent: Hi there, my name is Jane and I'm a customer service agent with Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today? 

Customer: Hi Jane, I'm really disappointed with Contoso Wireless. I've been a customer for a few years now and the service keeps getting worse. 

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for your dissatisfaction. Can you tell me more about what is making you unhappy? 

Customer: Well, first off, the coverage has been spotty at best. I'm constantly losing signal or experiencing dropped calls. And the prices keep going up every month! It's just not worth it anymore. 

Customer Service Agent: That does sound frustrating. I understand why you're unhappy with our service. We would never want to leave a customer feeling like this. Do you mind if I ask why you haven't switched providers yet? 

Customer: Well, I've been considering it but I don't know which provider has better products or better deals than Contoso Wireless. It's hard to make an informed decision without knowing what else is out there. 

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! Let me see what kind of information I can provide you with so that you can make an informed decision. Do you mind if I ask what kind of features and services are most important to you? 

Customer: Definitely. The main things I'm looking for are reliable coverage, affordable plans, and good customer service. 

Customer Service Agent: Got it! Let me do some research and see what options are available that meet your needs. Can I call you back in a few hours to discuss my findings? 

Customer: Sure, that sounds great! Thanks for taking the time to help me out with this. 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day and I'll be in touch soon!
