Agent: Of course! The Contoso Wireless phone is an amazing device that offers reliable coverage and unbeatable speeds. It's perfect for anyone who needs to stay connected while on the go. What questions do you have about it?

Customer: I see, but what if I want to downgrade my services? Can I still use the phone?

Agent: Absolutely! You can downgrade your services at any time and still use the Contoso Wireless phone. We offer several different packages that are tailored to meet different needs and budgets. Is there a specific package that you're interested in?

Customer: Yes, I'm interested in the basic package with the lowest level of service. Will that work with the Contoso Wireless phone?

Agent: Absolutely! The basic package will work just fine with the Contoso Wireless phone. You'll still be able to make calls, send text messages, and access the internet, although at lower speeds than with higher packages. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: Yes, actually. How much data will I get with this package? 

Agent: With the basic package, you'll get 1GB of data per month. If you need more data, you can always upgrade to a higher package at any time. Is there anything else I can help you with? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thanks for your help! 

Agent: No problem! If you have any other questions or concerns about the Contoso Wireless phone or our services, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're always happy to help! Have a great day!
