Customer Service Agent:

Hello, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless! My name is [Name], how may I help you today? 

Customer: 

Yes, hi. I recently purchased a phone from your company and I'm not happy with the service I'm receiving. The phone keeps dropping calls and the reception is terrible. It's making it very difficult to use. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I apologize for the inconvenience you are experiencing. We value our customers and want to make sure you have a great experience with our products. Can you tell me more about the phone you purchased? 

Customer: 

Sure. It's the new Contoso Wireless phone model X-750. It was supposed to be the best phone on the market but it's not living up to my expectations. 

Customer Service Agent: 

I understand your frustration. Let me look into this further and see what we can do to help. Can you tell me a bit more about the issues you are having with the phone? 

Customer: 

Well, like I said, it keeps dropping calls and the reception is really bad. I also can't seem to get any data coverage at all. And when I try to make a call, it takes forever to connect and then it just cuts out after a few seconds. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I apologize for the poor performance of your phone. We will do our best to resolve this issue for you as quickly as possible. To begin, can you tell me what kind of coverage area you are in? That will help us narrow down the issue and provide a better solution for you. 

Customer: 
I'm in an urban area with a good amount of cell towers so I don't think that should be an issue. But regardless, this phone is unacceptable and I need something better. Is there any way I can downgrade my service and get a different phone? 

Customer Service Agent: 
Yes, we can certainly look into downgrading your service and providing you with a different phone. However, please note that downgrading your service may mean that some features of your current plan may no longer be available or may incur additional fees or charges. Before we proceed further, can you tell me why you would like to downgrade your service? 

Customer: 
Well, it's pretty obvious why - this phone isn't working well at all and I need something better. If downgrading my service is the only way to get a better phone then that's what I'll do. 

Customer Service Agent: 
I understand your frustration and would like to help resolve this issue as soon as possible. To begin, we can start by downgrading your service plan and replacing your current phone with another one of our models that may better suit your needs. Would that be okay?
