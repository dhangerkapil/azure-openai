Hi, I recently purchased a TV from Contoso Wireless and I'm a bit confused about my billing. Can you help?

Agent: 
Hello there! Yes, of course we can help you out with any billing inquiries you may have. Can you please tell me more about your confusion?

Customer: 
Well, I'm not sure if I'm being charged the right amount. I don't know how much I should be paying and when I should be paying it.

Agent: 
I understand your concern. The amount that you are being charged is determined by the type of TV that you purchased. Can you tell me what type of TV did you purchase? 

Customer: 
Yes, I got a 50 inch LED smart TV. It has all the latest features. 

Agent: 
That's great! The cost for that type of TV would be $599.99 plus taxes and shipping fees. You will be billed monthly for the cost of the TV and any other fees associated with it. Are there any other questions that I can help you with? 

Customer: 
Actually yes, I was wondering if there are any warranties associated with this product?

Agent: 
Yes, we do offer warranties for our TVs. Our standard warranty is for one year from the date of purchase and covers any defects or damages to the TV. We also offer an extended warranty for an additional cost which covers additional damages or defects that may arise after the first year of purchase. Do you have any other questions? 

Customer: 
No, that's all I wanted to know about my billing. Thanks for your help! 

Agent: 
No problem at all! We're always here to help. Is there anything else we can do for you today?
