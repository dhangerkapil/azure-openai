Customer: Hi, I was wondering about my billing for the month. Is there a way I can get a better deal? 

Customer Service Agent: Absolutely! We have a few different options available to our customers. What type of phone plan are you currently on? 

Customer: I'm on the basic plan with two lines. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, great. We can look into seeing what other plans might work better for you and your needs. Can you tell me a little bit more about how you use your phone and what type of usage you have? 

Customer: Sure. I mainly use my phone for texting, making calls, and occasional data usage. 

Customer Service Agent: Great, that helps us get an idea of what plan might be the best fit for you. Let me take a look at our current plans and see what we can do for you. 

Customer: Sounds good. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, so it looks like we have a few different plans that could work for your usage pattern. We have a basic plan which would give you unlimited talk and text, plus 2GB of data for $40 per month. Then we have an enhanced plan which gives you unlimited talk and text, plus 5GB of data for $50 per month. Finally, we have an unlimited plan which gives you unlimited talk and text plus unlimited data for $60 per month. Which one of these plans would you be interested in? 

Customer: The enhanced plan seems like it would be the best option for me since I don't use a lot of data. 

Customer Service Agent: Perfect! We can get that set up right away for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: Actually yes, I was wondering if there were any other products or services that Contoso Wireless offers that might be of interest to me?
