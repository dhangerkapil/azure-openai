Customer: I'm so angry right now. I just bought a new Contoso Wireless TV and it isn't working at all!

Customer Service Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please explain what is wrong with the TV?

Customer: It won't even turn on. Nothing happens when I press the power button. 

Customer Service Agent: I see. Can you please tell me if the power cord is plugged in correctly? 

Customer: Of course it is! It's plugged in correctly and still nothing happens. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let's try to troubleshoot this issue. Have you tried unplugging the TV and plugging it back in? 

Customer: Yes, I already tried that. Nothing happened! 

Customer Service Agent: Is there anything else that you have done to troubleshoot the issue? 

Customer: No, nothing else. I've followed all the instructions and nothing works. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, can you please tell me what type of outlet you are using to plug in the TV? 

Customer: It's a standard three-prong outlet. 

Customer Service Agent: Okay, great. Can you please check if any of the outlets have a reset button or switch that needs to be pressed or switched on?  

Customer: There is no reset button or switch on any of the outlets. 

Customer Service Agent: In that case, can you please try using a different outlet to plug in the TV?  

Customer: Yes, I'll try that now. 

Customer Service Agent: Great, please let me know if that works or if you have any other issues.
