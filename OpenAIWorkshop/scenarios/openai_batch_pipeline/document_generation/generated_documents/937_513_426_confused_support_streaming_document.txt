Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble streaming the Contoso Wireless product. Can you help me?

Agent: Hi there! I'd be happy to help. Can you tell me what kind of trouble you're having with streaming?

Customer: Well, I can't seem to get it to work. Every time I try to stream something, it just won't connect. 

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Are you using the Contoso Wireless app or a different streaming service? 

Customer: No, I'm using the Contoso Wireless app. 

Agent: Alright, that's great. Could you please tell me what kind of device you're using and what operating system it has? 

Customer: Yes, sure. I'm using an iPhone 8 Plus and the operating system is iOS 12. 

Agent: Okay, great. Have you tried restarting your device or uninstalling and reinstalling the Contoso Wireless app? 

Customer: Yes, I've tried both of those things but it still won't work. 

Agent: Alright, let me take a closer look at this for you. Could you please provide me with your account information so that I can access your account and see what's going on? 

Customer: Sure, my username is JohnSmith and my password is 123456. 

Agent: Perfect, thank you for that information. Give me one moment while I take a look at your account.

Agent: Okay, John, it looks like there was an issue with your account settings that was preventing streaming from working properly. I've fixed the issue now and it should be working properly again. Can you please try streaming something again and let me know if it works? 

Customer: Sure thing! Let me give it a try now... Wow, it worked! Thank you so much for your help! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
