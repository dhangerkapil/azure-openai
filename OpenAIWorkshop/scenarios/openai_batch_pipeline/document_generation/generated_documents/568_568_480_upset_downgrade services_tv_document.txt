"Hello, I recently purchased the Contoso Wireless TV service and it has been horrible. The picture is pixelated, the sound is awful, and I can't even get the channels I wanted. I'm really disappointed in the service and want to know what my options are."

Agent:
"I apologize for the dissatisfaction with our service. Can you tell me more about your issue? Are you having trouble with a specific channel?"

Customer: 
"Yes, I'm having trouble with a few channels. The picture quality is terrible and I can't get some of the channels that were advertised. I'm not happy with this service and want to know what my options are."

Agent:
"I understand your frustration. Let me look into this further to see what options we have for you. Could you provide me with your account information so that I can look into this further?"

Customer: 
"Sure, my account number is XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX. Can you tell me what my options are for downgrading my service?"

Agent: 
"Let me look into that for you. Please give me one moment while I review your account." 

(Agent takes a few moments to review customer's account) 

Agent: 
"Based on your account information, I can offer you a few options for downgrading your service. We can offer you a discounted package that includes fewer channels at a lower cost or we can remove certain channels from your current package." 

Customer: 
"That sounds great! What is the cost of the discounted package? And which channels would be included in that package?" 

Agent: 
"The discounted package would cost $XX per month and it would include XX channels. We can also remove certain channels from your current package if you'd like to keep some of the ones that you already have." 

Customer: 
"That sounds great! Can you tell me which channels will be removed if I choose that option?" 

Agent: 
"Sure, we can remove XX, XX, and XX channels from your current package. Is there anything else I can help you with today?" 

Customer: 
"No, that should do it. Thank you for your help!"
