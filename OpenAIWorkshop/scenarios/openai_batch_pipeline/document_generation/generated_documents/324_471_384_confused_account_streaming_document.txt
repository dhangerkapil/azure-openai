Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what's happening?

Customer: Well, I've been trying to access the streaming service for the past few days, but I can't seem to get it to work. 

Agent: Alright, let's take a look. Can you tell me what device you are using and what version of the Contoso Wireless app you are running? 

Customer: I'm using an iPhone 8 and the latest version of the app. 

Agent: Great, thanks for that information. Can you try logging out of your account and then logging back in again? This can often resolve any issues you may be experiencing with streaming. 

Customer: Okay, I'll try that now. 

Agent: Perfect, let me know how it goes. 

Customer: Alright, I logged out and logged back in again and now it seems to be working. Thanks for your help! 

Agent: No problem at all! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: Actually, yes. I was wondering if there were any new streaming services available that I could subscribe to? 

Agent: Yes, we have recently added a few new streaming services that you can subscribe to. Let me send you a list of our current offerings so you can see what's available. 

Customer: That would be great, thank you! 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thanks again for your help! 

Agent: No problem at all! Have a great day!
