Agent: Absolutely! What billing issues are you experiencing?

Customer: Well, I received a bill for a product I never ordered and it seems like I'm being charged for something I didn't purchase. 

Agent: I apologize for the confusion. Can you provide me with your account number so that I can take a look?

Customer: Sure, my account number is XXXXXXX.

Agent: Thank you for providing that information. After looking through your account, it appears that you have been charged for a new phone that was added to your plan recently. Is this correct? 

Customer: Yes, that's right. But why am I being charged for a phone that I never asked for? 

Agent: It appears that the phone was added to your plan as part of a promotional offer. Are you aware of this offer? 

Customer: No, I wasn't aware of any promotional offers. How much am I being charged for the phone? 

Agent: You are being charged $600 for the phone plus taxes and fees. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: Yes, actually. Can you tell me more about this promotional offer and how it works? 

Agent: Certainly! This promotion is an exclusive offer from Contoso Wireless where customers can get a free phone when they sign up for our premium plan. The offer includes unlimited talk, text and data plus access to our exclusive network of stores and services. Does this sound like something you would be interested in? 

Customer: That does sound like a great deal! But what about the charges on my current bill? Will those be waived if I switch to the premium plan? 

Agent: Yes, absolutely! If you switch to our premium plan, we will waive all charges related to the phone on your current bill. Would you like to switch plans today? 

Customer: Yes, that would be great! How do I go about switching my plan? 

Agent: Switching your plan is easy! All you need to do is log into your account online and select the premium plan option. From there, you'll be able to review all the details of the plan and make sure it's right for you. Once you're ready to switch, just follow the instructions on screen and we'll take care of the rest. Does that sound good? 

Customer: Yes, that sounds great! Thanks for all your help.
