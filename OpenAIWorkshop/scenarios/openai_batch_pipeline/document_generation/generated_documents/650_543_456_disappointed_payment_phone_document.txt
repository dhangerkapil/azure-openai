Hello, I recently purchased a new phone from Contoso Wireless and I am having trouble making a payment. I was wondering if you could help me out?

Agent: 
Hello there! I would be more than happy to help you out. Could you please provide me with some details regarding your purchase so that I can assist you better?

Customer: 
Sure, I bought the Contoso 5G phone last week and I am trying to make the payment online but it is not going through.

Agent: 
I see. Well, let's take a look at this issue. Could you provide me with the order number associated with your purchase so that I can pull up your account?

Customer: 
Yes, the order number is 123456.

Agent: 
Thank you for providing that information. Let me just take a moment to pull up your account. Please bear with me for a few moments.

Ok, I have located your account and it looks like the payment was not successful due to insufficient funds in your account. Is this correct? 

Customer: 
Yes, that is correct. Is there any way to rectify this issue? 

Agent: 
Yes, absolutely! We have several options available for our customers when it comes to making payments. You can choose to make the payment via credit/debit card, PayPal, or even bank transfer. Would any of these options be suitable for you? 

Customer: 
Yes, I think a bank transfer would be the best option for me. Can you tell me how to go about doing that? 

Agent: 
Absolutely! All you need to do is transfer the amount owed to our bank account with the following details - Account Name: Contoso Wireless Bank Name: ABC Bank Account Number: 1234567890 Once you have made the transfer, please do not forget to email us at info@contosowireless.com with the transaction reference number so that we can track it easily. Does that sound good?  

Customer: 
Yes, that sounds great! Thank you for all your help!
