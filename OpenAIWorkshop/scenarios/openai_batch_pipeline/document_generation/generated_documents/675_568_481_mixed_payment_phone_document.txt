Customer: Hi, I'm a customer of Contoso Wireless and I'm having some issues with payment for my phone.

Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

Customer: Well, I purchased a phone from Contoso Wireless and was supposed to pay in two installments. I made the first payment but the second payment is due soon and I don't think I can afford it right now.

Agent: I understand your concern. Is there any way we can work something out so that you can still make the payment?

Customer: Yes, I was hoping there might be some kind of payment plan or extension that would allow me to pay off the balance over time.

Agent: Absolutely! We offer several payment plans that can help you spread out the cost of your phone over several months. Would you like to hear more about them?

Customer: Yes, please. That would be great.

Agent: Okay, sure. We have a few different options available for our customers. The first option is a standard installment plan, where you can spread out your payments over three months. The second option is a deferred payment plan, where you don't have to make any payments for six months and then pay off the balance in one lump sum. The third option is a monthly payment plan, where you can make smaller monthly payments over a longer period of time. Which one sounds like it would work best for you?

Customer: The deferred payment plan sounds like it would work best for me right now. Can you tell me more about it? 

Agent: Absolutely! With the deferred payment plan, you don't have to make any payments for six months and then pay off the balance in one lump sum after that period has ended. Is this something that would work for your current situation? 

Customer: Yes, that would work great for me right now. 

Agent: Wonderful! I'm glad we could find an option that works for you. Let me just go ahead and set up this plan for you and we'll get everything squared away shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: No, that should do it for now. Thank you so much for your help!
