Customer: I just received my new Contoso Wireless TV and I'm having a problem with it.

Agent: Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you please provide me with some more information about the issue?

Customer: Yes, I set up the TV and when I try to turn it on, nothing happens. It's like it's dead.

Agent: I see. Are you sure you followed all of the setup instructions correctly?

Customer: Yes, I followed them step-by-step. There is obviously something wrong with the TV.

Agent: Okay, let's take a look at your account and see if there is any issue with the TV or your account that may be causing this problem. What is your account number? 

Customer: 123456 

Agent: Okay, let me take a look here. It looks like everything on your account is in order and there are no issues that could be causing this problem. Let's take a closer look at the TV itself. Have you checked the power cord to make sure it is securely plugged in? 

Customer: Yes, of course I have! Don't you think I would have done that already? I know how to troubleshoot basic problems. This isn't my first time setting up a TV. 

Agent: No, of course not! I apologize for asking; I just wanted to make sure we had exhausted all possibilities before moving on to more complex troubleshooting steps. Can you please tell me what type of power outlet you are using for the TV? 

Customer: It's a standard US outlet. 

Agent: Alright, let's try this then. Please unplug the power cord from the wall and then plug it back in again after 10 seconds. Then press and hold the power button on the TV for 10 seconds and then release it. This should reset the TV and hopefully resolve your issue. 

Customer: Okay, I'll try that now... Wow, it worked! The TV is up and running now! Thank you so much for helping me out with this! 

Agent: You're welcome! Glad to hear that the reset worked for you and that your issue has been resolved! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
