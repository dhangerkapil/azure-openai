Customer: I just received my statement from Contoso Wireless and I am not happy. It says I am being charged for streaming services, but I never signed up for that. Can you explain what is going on?

Agent: Hi there! I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. We do offer streaming services, but it is an optional add-on to our plans. It looks like you were signed up for this without your knowledge. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right. I never signed up for any streaming services, so why am I being charged for it?

Agent: We are sorry for the confusion. Our records indicate that the streaming service was added to your account in April of this year. Do you remember signing up for this at any point?

Customer: No, absolutely not. This is very frustrating and I want to know why I am being charged for something I didn't even sign up for. 

Agent: We understand your frustration and we are here to help resolve this issue. Our records show that a promotion was offered to all customers at the time of sign-up which included a free trial of our streaming services. It looks like you were automatically enrolled in this promotion when you signed up with us. 

Customer: That still doesn't explain why I'm being charged now when the trial period should be over. 

Agent: The free trial period of our streaming services is two months long, and since it has been more than two months since you signed up, the service was automatically converted into a paid subscription at the end of the trial period. 

Customer: That doesn't make sense! Why wasn't I informed about this before it happened? 

Agent: We apologize if we did not communicate this information clearly enough to you. We typically send emails or text messages informing customers about upcoming changes to their accounts, such as when their free trials are ending or when their plans are changing, but it looks like you may have missed these notifications due to an incorrect email address or phone number on file with us. 

Customer: So what can be done about this now? Can I get a refund for the charges? 

Agent: Absolutely! We can refund any charges associated with the streaming service that have been applied to your account within the last 90 days. Would you like me to process a refund for you now?
