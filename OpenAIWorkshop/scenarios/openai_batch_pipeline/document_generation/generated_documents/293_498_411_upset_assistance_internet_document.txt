Welcome to Contoso Wireless. How can I help you today? 

Customer: 
I just bought one of your internet packages, but I'm having trouble getting it to work. I'm really frustrated because I need it to do some important work. 

Customer Service Agent:
I understand how important it is to get your internet working as soon as possible. Can you please provide me with some details so that I can try to help you?

Customer: 
Well, I've tried connecting my laptop to the modem and router but nothing seems to be happening. I'm not sure what else I can do. 

Customer Service Agent:
Let's start by checking if your device is compatible with our internet package. Is your laptop a Windows or Mac OS system? 

Customer: 
It's a Windows laptop. 

Customer Service Agent:
Great, now let's check if you have the correct settings for the connection. Can you please tell me the version of your operating system? 

Customer: 
It's Windows 10. 

Customer Service Agent:
Alright, let's take a look at the settings. Can you open the Network and Sharing Center on your computer? 

Customer: 
Yes, I can do that. 

Customer Service Agent:
Once you open the Network and Sharing Center, click on "Change Adapter Settings" and then select "Wireless Network Connection". After that, right-click on it and select Properties. From there, make sure that the box next to "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" is checked and then click on "OK". Now try connecting again and see if that works for you.  

Customer: 
I just tried it and it worked! Thank you so much for your help! 

 Customer Service Agent: 
You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
