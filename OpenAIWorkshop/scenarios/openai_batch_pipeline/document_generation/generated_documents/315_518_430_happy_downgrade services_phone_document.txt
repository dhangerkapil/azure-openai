Agent: Hi there, thank you for reaching out to us at Contoso Wireless. We are happy to help you with any questions or concerns you may have about your phone. What services are you looking to downgrade?

Customer: I was thinking about downgrading my data plan. 

Agent: Okay, great. We can certainly help you with that. Can you tell me which phone model you purchased and how long ago? 

Customer: I purchased the Contoso Wireless 9500 and it was just last week. 

Agent: Wonderful. We can definitely help you downgrade your data plan on that model. Is there a specific reason why you're wanting to downgrade? 

Customer: Yes, actually. I realized that my current plan is too expensive for what I need it for. 

Agent: No problem at all! We understand that sometimes plans can be a bit pricey and we want to make sure our customers get the best value for their money. Are there any other features or services you'd like to downgrade? 

Customer: Not right now, but maybe in the future if needed. 

Agent: Absolutely! We are always here to help you make changes to your account whenever necessary. Now, let's talk about your data plan specifically. What type of plan would you like to switch to? 

Customer: Could I switch to the basic plan? 

Agent: Yes, absolutely! The basic plan offers 1GB of data per month with unlimited talk and text. Is this something that would work for you? 

Customer: That sounds perfect! How do I go about switching my plan? 

Agent: Great! All you need to do is log into your account online and select the "downgrade" option from the menu. From there, you'll be able to select the basic plan and make the switch. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
