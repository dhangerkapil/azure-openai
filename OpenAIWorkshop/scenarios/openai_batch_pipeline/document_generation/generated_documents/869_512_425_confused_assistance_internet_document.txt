Customer Service Agent: Welcome to Contoso Wireless, how may I help you today?

Customer: Hi there, I'm having some trouble with your internet service. Can you help?

Customer Service Agent: Of course, what seems to be the issue?

Customer: Well, I just moved in and I'm trying to set up my internet service but it's not working.

Customer Service Agent: Okay, can you tell me a bit more about what is happening? Are you able to connect to the network at all or is it completely failing?

Customer: Well, I'm able to connect to the network but I can't seem to get an internet connection. It keeps saying that it's not available.

Customer Service Agent: Alright, it sounds like you may be having some trouble with your modem. Let's try resetting it first and see if that helps. Can you do that for me? 

Customer: Yes, sure. How do I do that? 

Customer Service Agent: No problem. To reset your modem, all you need to do is unplug the power cord from the back of the modem and wait 30 seconds before plugging it back in again. Once it's powered back on, check to see if your internet connection is working properly. 

Customer: Ok, I've done that but I still don't have an internet connection. 

Customer Service Agent: Alright, let's try one more thing. Can you access the settings page of your modem? 

Customer: Yes, I can do that. 

Customer Service Agent: Perfect. Once you're on the settings page, scroll down until you find the option for DHCP Renewal and make sure that it's enabled. That should help with getting your internet connection back up and running. 

Customer: Ok, I did that and now my internet is working! Thank you so much for your help! 

Customer Service Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
