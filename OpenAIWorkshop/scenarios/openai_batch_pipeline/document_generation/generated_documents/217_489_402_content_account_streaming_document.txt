Agent: Hi there! Yes, of course. What kind of issue are you experiencing with the streaming feature?

Customer: Well, I can't seem to access it. It just keeps saying "Account not found" when I try to log in. 

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take a look at your account and see what's going on. Can you provide me with your account number? 

Customer: Sure, it's 67890-12345-6789. 

Agent: Great, thank you. One moment please while I take a look at your account... Ok, it looks like there was an issue with your payment information that caused the streaming feature to become unavailable. 

Customer: Oh no! Is there anything I can do to fix it? 

Agent: Absolutely! We just need to update your payment information so that we can reactivate the streaming feature on your account. Do you have a credit or debit card that we can use for this purpose? 

Customer: Yes, I do. What information do you need? 

Agent: We just need the card number, expiration date, and security code. Once we have this information, we'll be able to process the payment and reactivate the streaming feature on your account. 

Customer: Alright, here's the information you need. 

Agent: Perfect! Let me just process this payment and get the streaming feature back up and running for you... Ok, everything looks good here! The streaming feature should now be available on your account. 

Customer: That's great news! Thank you so much for helping me out with this issue. 

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
