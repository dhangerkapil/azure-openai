Hello, I am calling because I recently signed up for Contoso Wireless and am trying to upgrade my internet services. I'm frustrated that I have not been able to get the speeds that were promised to me. Can you help?

Agent:

Hello, thank you for calling Contoso Wireless. I apologize for any frustration you may have experienced. We take customer satisfaction very seriously and would like to help you get the service you were promised. Can you tell me more about what is happening? 

Customer:

Sure. When I signed up for the service, they said I would get speeds of up to 200 Mbps, but when I tested it, I'm only getting speeds of about 25 Mbps. That's not even close to what was promised! 

Agent:

I understand your frustration. Let me take a look into your account and see what's going on. Can you provide me with your account number? 

Customer:

Yes, it is [account number]. 

Agent: 
Thank you for providing that information. Let me take a look and see what's going on. In the meantime, can you tell me if you're using a router or modem? 

Customer: 
Yes, I'm using a router and modem from Contoso Wireless. 

Agent: 
Alright, let me check and see if there are any issues with your router or modem that could be causing the slow speeds. In the meantime, can you tell me if there are any other devices connected to your network? 

 Customer: Yes, there are two laptops and one tablet connected to my network. 

 Agent: Okay, great. Let me take a look at the settings on your router and modem and see if there is anything that could be causing the slow speeds. In the meantime, can you try restarting all of your devices connected to the network? That might help with the speed issue. 

 Customer: Okay, sure. I'll try that and let you know if it helps. 

 Agent: Great! Once you've restarted all of your devices, give me a call back so we can discuss what else we can do to help get your speeds up to where they should be. Thank you for your patience!
