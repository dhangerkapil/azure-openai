Customer: Hi there, I'm looking to downgrade my Contoso Wireless service and I was wondering if you could help me?

Agent: Hi there! My name is [Name], and I'm a customer service agent for Contoso Wireless. How can I help you with your downgrade today?

Customer: Sure! I was hoping to downgrade my current plan, as I don't need all the features that come with it. What are my options?

Agent: Absolutely! We have several different plans that may suit your needs better. Our basic plan offers unlimited talk and text, plus 500 MB of data for only $35 a month. We also have a variety of family plans available. 

Customer: That sounds great! But what about TV services? Is that something that's available with the basic plan?

Agent: Unfortunately, no. TV services are not available with the basic plan. However, if you choose one of our family plans, you can add on our Contoso TV package for an additional fee. This package includes access to over 100 channels, including all the major networks, as well as a variety of specialty channels. 

Customer: Wow, that sounds great! Can you tell me a bit more about this package? 

Agent: Absolutely! With Contoso TV, you'll get access to all the major networks like ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX. Plus, you'll get access to over 100 other channels including ESPN, AMC, HBO and more. You'll also get access to our on-demand library which has thousands of movies and shows to choose from. 

Customer: That sounds amazing! What's the cost for this package? 

Agent: The cost for the Contoso TV package is an additional $30 per month when added to one of our family plans. 

Customer: Perfect! That sounds like a great deal. What do I need to do in order to add this package to my current plan? 

Agent: All you need to do is call us at 1-800-555-1234 and one of our agents will be happy to help you add the Contoso TV package to your current plan. We can even help you switch over from your current plan to one of our family plans if you'd like. 

Customer: That sounds great! I think I'll go ahead and switch over then. Thanks so much for all your help!
