Hello, I'm looking to downgrade my services with Contoso Wireless. I currently have the TV package and I wanted to know what options I have available to me.

Agent: 
Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to reach out. We appreciate your loyalty. 
We can certainly help you downgrade your services. What specifically were you looking for?

Customer: 
I'm looking to downgrade my current TV package. Is there a way to get the same channels but at a lower cost?

Agent: 
Yes, we do offer several different packages that could provide you with the same channels at a lower cost. Would you like me to explain the details of each option?

Customer: 
Yes, please! I would love to hear more about what you offer.

Agent: 
Great! We offer three different TV packages that could meet your needs: Basic, Standard, and Premium. The Basic package is our lowest cost option and offers 40+ channels at a rate of $19.99 per month. The Standard package includes 75+ channels at a rate of $29.99 per month, and the Premium package includes 125+ channels at a rate of $39.99 per month. All packages come with access to our On Demand library as well as access to our streaming service ContosoTV+. Would any of these packages work for you? 

Customer: 
That sounds great! I think the Standard package would be best for me since it's still a good deal but doesn't include as many channels as the Premium package. Could you tell me more about the On Demand library and ContosoTV+? 

Agent: 
Absolutely! The On Demand library is our selection of movies and TV shows that are available for rent or purchase, depending on the title. You can also watch select titles from the library for free with ads. ContosoTV+ is our streaming service which gives you access to thousands of hours of content from networks such as HBO, Showtime, and Starz. You can stream live or on demand content on your mobile device or laptop wherever you are. Does that sound like something that would interest you? 

Customer: 
That sounds really great! So if I choose the Standard package, I'll get access to all of this plus 75+ channels for only $29.99 per month? That's an amazing deal! 

Agent: 
I'm glad you think so! That's correct - you will get all of these features with the Standard package for only $29.99 per month. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

Customer: 
No, that's everything! Thank you so much for your help - I'm very happy with my decision to downgrade my services with Contoso Wireless!
