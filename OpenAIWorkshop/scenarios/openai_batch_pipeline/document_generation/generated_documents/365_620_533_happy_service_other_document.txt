Agent: Hi there, how can I help you?

Customer: I recently purchased a product from your company and I'm having some trouble setting it up. Is there someone who can walk me through it?

Agent: Absolutely. I'm more than happy to help. What type of product did you purchase?

Customer: It's a Contoso Wireless Smartphone.

Agent: Ok great, let me take a look at the setup instructions and see what I can do to help you. Can you tell me what kind of difficulty you're having?

Customer: Well, I'm trying to connect the phone to my home Wi-Fi network, but it's not working. I've tried entering in the network password several times, but it still won't connect. 

Agent: Alright, that's a fairly common issue. Let me see if I can troubleshoot the issue for you. First off, have you made sure that your home Wi-Fi is enabled and that the signal is strong enough? 

Customer: Yes, the signal is strong and I'm able to connect other devices to the network just fine. 

Agent: Ok great. Let's try resetting your network settings on the phone and then try connecting again. To do this, go to your settings menu and select "Reset Network Settings". Once this is done, try connecting to your home Wi-Fi again. 

Customer: Ok, I've done that and it still won't connect. 

Agent: That's ok, we can try a few more things before giving up. Have you tried using an alternate method of connecting such as using a USB cable or Bluetooth? 

Customer: No, I haven't tried that yet. 

Agent: That's ok, let's give it a shot. Try plugging in your phone via USB cable or connecting via Bluetooth and see if that works any better. 

Customer: Ok, I'll give it a try now. 

Agent: Great! While you're doing that, let me look into some other possible solutions in case this doesn't work out for you. 

Customer: Alright sounds good!

 Customer: Hey it worked! Thank you so much for all your help! 

 Agent: You're welcome! Glad we were able to get this figured out for you! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
