The Azure OpenAI service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models on the Azure cloud. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.

To try these examples, youâ€™ll need an Azure account with Azure OpenAI Service.
Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.
