In this article, we'll explain what an SLA is, the benefits of having one in place, and what specific items you should be aware of when it comes to your ADP payroll SLA.\n\nTo start with, an SLA is a contract that outlines the service a customer can expect from a third-party vendor like ADP. In the case of payroll management, the SLA is an agreement between your employer and ADP that spells out the specifics of the payroll services that ADP will provide, including turnaround times and response times for any issues or questions that may arise.\n\nOne of the main advantages of having an SLA in place is that it sets clear expectations for both parties. Your employer knows what to expect from ADP, and ADP knows what's expected of them. This leads to more efficient operations, improves communication, and ultimately results in a better overall payroll experience for everyone involved.\n\nNow, when it comes to your ADP payroll SLA, there are a few key items that you should be aware of. First and foremost is the turnaround time for payroll processing. This is the time it takes for ADP to receive your payroll information from your employer, process it, and distribute the funds to your bank account or pay you via a paper check. It's important to know what the typical turnaround time is and what to expect if there are any delays.\n\nAnother important aspect of your ADP payroll SLA is the response time for customer service inquiries. If you have a question or concern about your payroll, you want to know how long it will take for ADP to respond to you. Most SLAs include a response time guarantee, such as a commitment to respond to all inquiries within a certain number of hours or days.\n\nOther items that may be included in your ADP payroll SLA include data security and confidentiality, disaster recovery protocols in case of system outages or other emergencies, and any penalties or incentives for failing to meet SLA commitments.", "article_74###Login issues": "Sometimes employees may experience difficulty logging into their ADP account.
